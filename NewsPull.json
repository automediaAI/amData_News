Rates of the disease have already risen eight-fold globally since 2000, driven largely by climate change as well as the increased movement of people and urbanization.Many cases go unrecorded, but in 2022 4.2 million cases were reported worldwide and public health officials have warned that near-record levels of transmission are expected this year. Bangladesh is currently experiencing its worst-ever outbreak, with more than 1,000 deaths.\u201cWe need to talk much more proactively about dengue,\u201d Jeremy Farrar, an infectious diseases specialist who joined the World Health Organization in May this year, told Reuters.\u201cWe need to really prepare countries for how they will deal with the additional pressure that will come\u2026 in the future in many, many big cities.\u201dFarrar previously spent 18 years working in Vietnam on tropical diseases including dengue. He later headed up the Wellcome Trust global health charity and advised the UK government on its COVID-19 response before joining the WHO in May this year.Farrar said the infection is likely to \u201ctake off\u201d and become endemic in parts of the United States, Europe and Africa - all regions where there has already been some limited local transmission - as global warming makes new areas hospitable to the mosquitoes that spread it. That will put acute pressure on hospital systems in many countries, he warned.\u201cThe clinical care is really intensive, it requires a high ratio of nurses to patients,\u201d he said. \u201cI really worry when this becomes a big issue in sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d[1/2]Mosquitoes are seen on stagnant water on the roadside during countrywide dengue infection, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, August 24, 2023. REUTERS/Mohammad Ponir Hossain/File Photo  Acquire Licensing RightsMost people who get dengue do not have symptoms, meaning case rates are thought to be far higher than the reported numbers. Those who do can experience fever, muscle spasms and joint pain so severe it is known as \u201cbreak-bone fever.\u201d In severe cases \u2013 less than 1% - it can be fatal.There is no specific treatment for dengue, although there is a vaccine available. Earlier this week, the WHO recommended Takeda Pharmaceuticals' (4502.T) Qdenga vaccine for children aged 6 to 16 in areas where the infection is a significant public health problem.Qdenga is also approved by the EU regulator, but Takeda withdrew its application in the United States earlier this year, citing data collection issues. Takeda said it was still in talks with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration about the vaccine.Preparing new regions of the world to deal with dengue means ensuring that any public health funds get spent in the right areas, Farrar said, including on the best way to control the mosquito.Dengue is spread by infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which behave differently to the malaria-carrying kind. For example, they bite people indoors, and they bite all day rather than overnight. They also breed in very shallow water.Farrar said proper prevention would include triaging plans for hospitals as well as scientific innovation alongside other key factors, such as urban planning, to avoid areas of standing water near or in houses.\u201cWe need to combine different sectors that are not used to working together,\u201d he said.Keep up with the latest medical breakthroughs and healthcare trends with our newsletter Reuters Health Rounds.

What happened in the few seconds after Armita Geravand entered the train on Sunday remains in question. While a friend told Iranian state television that she hit her head on the station\u2019s platform, the soundless footage aired by the broadcaster from outside of the car is blocked by a bystander. Just seconds later, her limp body is carried off. Geravand\u2019s mother and father appeared in state media footage saying a blood pressure issue, a fall or perhaps both contributed to their daughter\u2019s injury.  Activists abroad have alleged Geravand may have been pushed or attacked because she was not wearing the hijab. They demand an independent investigation by the United Nations\u2019 fact-finding mission on Iran, citing the theocracy\u2019s use of pressure on victims\u2019 families and state TV\u2019s history of airing hundreds of coerced confessions.  Geravand\u2019s injury also comes as Iran has put its morality police \u2014 whom activists implicate in Amini\u2019s death over her alleged loose hijab \u2014 back on the street, and as lawmakers push to enforce even stricter penalties for those flouting the required head covering.  \u201cGirls are subjected to violence on the streets, and then their families are compelled to protect the government responsible for that violence,\u201d said Hadi Ghaemi, the executive director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran.            \n   In this image from surveillance video aired by Iranian state television, women pull 16-year-old Armita Geravand from a train car on the Tehran Metro in Tehran, Iran, Sunday, Oct. 1, 2023.

(AP Photo/Iranian state television)       For observant Muslim women, the head covering is a sign of piety before God and modesty in front of men outside their families. In Iran, the hijab \u2014 and the all-encompassing black chador worn by some \u2014 has long been a political symbol as well, particularly after becoming mandatory in the years following the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iran and neighboring Taliban-ruled Afghanistan are the only countries where the hijab remains mandatory for women.Amini died in a hospital on Sept. 16, 2022, after she was detained by Iranian morality police on allegations of improperly wearing the hijab. Suspicions that she was beaten during her arrest led to mass protests that represented the largest challenge to Iran\u2019s theocratic government since the revolution.Since those large-scale protests subsided, many women in Tehran can be seen without the hijab in defiance of the law.Geravand suffered her injury Sunday morning at the Meydan-E Shohada, or Martyrs\u2019 Square, Metro station in southern Tehran. Rumors about how she suffered the injury quickly circulated. By Tuesday, the Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, which reports on abuses in Iran\u2019s western Kurdish region, published a photograph it said showed Geravand at the hospital, her head wrapped in bandages as she remains in a coma.  Geravand \u201cwas physically attacked by authorities in the Shohada station at Tehran Metro for what they perceived as noncompliance with the compulsory hijab,\u201d Hengaw alleged, citing reports it said it received. \u201cAs a result, she sustained severe injuries and was transported to the hospital.\u201dThe Associated Press has not been able to confirm the exact circumstances of what caused Geravand\u2019s injuries. Hengaw claimed Thursday that security forces arrested Geravand\u2019s mother, Shahin Ahmadi. Authorities in Tehran did not immediately acknowledge the claim, though semiofficial news agencies denied it.Late Wednesday, Iranian state television aired what appeared to be nearly all the surveillance camera footage covering the 16 minutes Geravand spent inside of the Metro station before her injury. She entered at 6:52 a.m., then went down an escalator. The sole gap, about a minute and a half, occurs before she reaches the turnstile gate where she uses her Metro card. The footage includes her shopping for a snack, then walking to and waiting on the platform for the train. In the mute footage, Geravand, whom activists describe as a taekwondo athlete, appears calm and healthy. An AP frame-by-frame analysis of the footage showed no signs of the aired video being manipulated. At 7:08 a.m., Geravand enters the No. 134 train car \u2014 the last on the train and likely a women-only compartment. A new conductor for the train walks up as she enters, his body blocking the view of door she walks through. Within four seconds, a woman steps backwards out of the train and just a sliver of Geravand\u2019s head can be seen as she lies on the floor of the train. Women then pull Geravand\u2019s limp body out and run for help as the train moves off. Iranian state TV\u2019s report, however, did not include any footage from inside the train itself and offered no explanation on why it hadn\u2019t been released. Most train cars on the Tehran Metro have multiple CCTV cameras, which are viewable by security personnel. \u201cRefusing to publish the footage only increases doubts about the official narrative,\u201d the Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights said. Emergency medical technicians took Geravand to Fajr Hospital, which is at a Iranian air force base and one of the the closest medical facilities to the station. In the time since her injury, security forces have arrested a journalist for Shargh newspaper who went to the hospital, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. Shargh, a reformist newspaper, helped lead reporting surrounding Amini\u2019s death as well.Already, Geravand\u2019s injury has drawn international attention, something Iran\u2019s government has sought to dismiss. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock wrote online: \u201cOnce again a young woman in #Iran is fighting for her life. Just because she showed her hair on the subway. It\u2019s unbearable.\u201d U.S. Deputy Special Envoy for Iran Abram Paley also wrote that he was \u201cshocked and concerned about reports that Iran\u2019s so-called morality police have assaulted 16-year-old Armita Geravand.\u201dIranian authorities likely worry about this incident escalating into popular anger like in Amini\u2019s case. Women continue to ignore the hijab law despite the growing crackdown. That includes what Shargh described as Tehran\u2019s city government hiring of some 400 people as \u201chijab guards\u201d to give verbal warnings, prevent uncovered women from entering subway cars and hand them over to police.", "filterCheck_Pass": {"checkBlockWord_title": true, "langEn_title": true, "lenCheck_title": true, "checkImageSize_title": true, "READY": true}, "keywords_article": ["Metro", "Iran", "Mahsa Amini"]}, "6": {"source_API": "NewsAPI", "mercury_worked": true, "query_name": "Top Headlines - US", "source_article": "ESPN", "title_article": "Justin Fields Bears beat Commanders to end 14-game losing streak - ESPN - ESPN", "description_article": "Justin Fields and the Chicago Bears put on a first-half show against the Washington Commanders at FedEx Field on Thursday.", "url_article": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38577968/justin-fields-bears-beat-commanders-end-14-game-losing-streak", "urtToImage_article": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F1006%2Fr1234574_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "publishedAt_article": "2023-10-06T03:36:00Z", "content_article": "playDJ Moore goes off for 230 yards and 3 TDs in Bears' 1st win (1:10)DJ Moore tallies eight receptions, 230 yards and three touchdowns in the Bears' victory over the Commanders.

Washington dropped to 2-3 with the loss.AP Photo/Alex BrandonChicago BearsThe Bears had enough of the negativity, of the outside noise, of the heartbreak they had endured for 11 straight months. On a short week with no time to waste on distractions, Chicago ended its 14-game losing streak and beat the Commanders on the road.Last week, Fields felt the Bears' offense was finally beginning to show its identity. After a lightning-fast start and third-quarter lull, Chicago showed it could finally put away an opponent and leave nothing in doubt in the final minutes of the game.One week after giving up 21 points en route to a devastating loss, the Bears' 20-point win is tied for the fourth largest in NFL history by a team entering on a double-digit losing streak.Buy/sell a breakout performance: DJ Moore found the end zone on two of Chicago's five scoring drives in the first half. His Randy Moss-like catch over Commanders cornerback Kendall Fuller and first-half stat line (five catches, 137 yards, 2 TDs ) helped the Bears build a 24-point lead going into the half and even had LeBron James marveling at the receiver's explosiveness on X. Moore's fourth-quarter touchdown -- his third of the game -- put the game away for Chicago on a night when he notched the second-most receiving yards in a game (230) by a Bears receiver.Encouraging trend: The Bears sacked Commanders QB Sam Howell five times -- which is great considering the team had only two sacks in its four previous games -- but two of those were generated by linebacker T.J. Edwards and cornerback Greg Stroman Jr. (who also recorded the team's first interception of the season against a starting quarterback). Chicago remains committed to pressuring with its four down linemen, but the line didn't break through until Yannick Ngakoue brought down Howell on second-and-9 in the fourth quarter. DeMarcus Walker and Rasheem Green recorded two more sacks late.QB breakdown: Fields became the first Bears quarterback to throw for three or more touchdowns in back-to-back games since the 1970 merger. He built upon his three good quarters against the Denver Broncos and has completed 43 of 64 pass attempts for 617 yards, eight touchdowns and one interception in his past two games, complete with a 131.2 passer rating. Most importantly, Fields didn't let a slow start to the second half hinder him from putting the game away when he found Moore for a 56-yard touchdown with 4:18 to play.Next game: vs. Minnesota Vikings (1 p.m. ET, Oct. 15)Brad Mills/USA TODAY SportsWashington CommandersThe Commanders' defense was supposed to provide a foundation while their offense matured. Instead, the defense sabotaged yet another game.The Commanders allowed at least 30 points for a fourth consecutive game in losing to the Chicago Bears 40-20 on Thursday night. The Commanders (2-3) have lost three consecutive games, including their past two home games by a combined 77-23 score.It's one thing to lose at home to Buffalo; it's another to lose at home to previously winless Chicago. Considering the Commanders have a young quarterback in Howell, the defense needed to provide a lot more. Instead, it gives up big plays and has not caused a turnover in the past two games.The defense talked all offseason and summer about starting fast, knowing that the unit added only one new starter in linebacker Cody Barton, in addition to first-round corner Emmanuel Forbes. But the Commanders have been bad. Thursday, they allowed an offense that ranked 21st entering the game in both points and yards to score a season-high 40 points and gain 451 yards. Washington needs to make it work with this group. It had a chance to gain momentum with upcoming games at Atlanta and the New York Giants. Instead the team exits this game with many questions about its defense -- and its future.Troubling trend: Washington's defense continues to allow too many big plays. The Commanders entered having allowed 13 plays of 25 yards or more, tied for worst in the NFL. Then they allowed three more in the first half alone Thursday night en route to a 27-3 deficit. A huge culprit has been a secondary that has looked inconsistent. Rookie Emmanuel Forbes, who was benched in the second half, has struggled mightily allowing big plays. There were, once more, big gaps in coverage that Fields exploited.Troubling trend, part 2: Poor pass protection. This has been another season-long problem as Howell was sacked five more times, giving him 29 for the season. The Bears, who entered with two sacks in four games, applied consistent pressure with four-man rushes and blitzes. Some of the problems stem from Howell needing to progress through his reads quicker. But the line has been too inconsistent in this area and needs to provide more help for a quarterback who now has six starts to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.QB breakdown: Howell's growth remains pivotal to the franchise's future. Howell showed, once more, that he's a resilient and tough quarterback. After a rough first half -- 9-for-13, 71 yards and an interception -- he threw for 298 yards in the second half. He moved well in the pocket, was patient with underneath throws, and though the Commanders lost, he continued to show he can be developed. Speeding up his progressions and learning to protect himself from hits should be points of emphasis going forward.Next game: at Atlanta Falcons (1 p.m. ET, Oct. 15)", "filterCheck_Pass": {"checkBlockWord_title": true, "langEn_title": true, "lenCheck_title": true, "checkImageSize_title": true, "READY": true}, "keywords_article": ["Justin Fields", "the Chicago Bears", "FedEx Field"]}, "7": {"source_API": "NewsAPI", "mercury_worked": true, "query_name": "Top Headlines - US", "source_article": "Eonline.com", "title_article": "Why Suki Waterhouse Took a \"Bout of Celibacy\" Before Dating Robert Pattinson - E!

Men could go and do whatever they wanted to do, and women were not supposed to.\"\u00a0\nHowever, Goldberg noted that, these days, the tables have turned.\n\"Now that has been shifting, and young women have been bitching about, you know, 'Why are you telling me what I should be [doing?],'\" the 67-year-old continued. \"Now, it's happening, and you're mad. I don't understand.\"\nBilson is now clarifying what she meant and addressing the Sister Act star's claims.\n\"I want to say that I've been a fan of Whoopi's for a very long time, so when I saw the tagline that she criticized something I said, I of course was concerned,\" she told Entertainment Weekly Oct. 5. \"We make it a very safe, open place to discuss anything, and we were just talking. I have the power to edit our podcast, and I chose to keep the conversation as a whole in, because a lot of the time in life, you say something, and maybe you have a minute and you reflect on it.\"Paras Griffin/Getty ImagesBilson explained that after sharing her initial thoughts on the podcast, she took a moment to reflect and ultimately\u00a0realized it's not her place\u00a0to dissect a person's sex life.\u00a0\n\"The point I get across is that it doesn't matter, and maybe in the past I would've looked at it [judgmentally], but I wouldn't do that anymore,\" the 42-year-old confessed. \"I made it clear that I don't want to sound judgmental, it was important that that point get across, not what I said initially.\"\nThe Hart of Dixie actress now hopes she can clear up any confusion listeners might\u00a0have.\n\"It was a flippant comment that I was just talking with friends, and then I retracted it, because even talking about it now, I'm like, I don't actually believe that,\" Bilson admitted. \"That's why I think it's important to stand up for it and clarify.\"\nKeep scrolling for all of Rachel's most NSFW confessions...Rachel Bilson wasn't afraid to make a shocking revelation about her sex life during a March 2023 episode of her Broad Ideas podcast, confessing that she had never experienced an orgasm from sexual intercourse until she was well into her 30s.\nThe reveal came after The O.C. star's guest Whitney Cummings\u00a0shared that her sex drive had increased since going off birth control. \"I have not had an orgasm from sex until I went off birth control,\"\u00a0Cummings said. \"Never had it in my life until I turned 40, but I could do it with my hands.\"\nBilson, 41, related to Cummings' experience, admitting that she didn't experience an orgasm until she was 38.\u00a0\"Isn't that crazy?\"\nRachel\u2060 also noted that she had previously gotten it done on her own, but \"not with, like, dick inside.\"Michael Loccisano/Getty Images Fro NYFW: The ShowsBilson continued to dish out bedroom confessions when she revealed her go-to sex position in a May 2023 episode of the\u00a0Women On Top podcast.\n\"I've learned that if you want to have an orgasm during sex, you have to be on top,\" Bilson shared. \"Missionary is my favorite.

Oh, that's funny.\"Gregory Pace/ShutterstockWhile some stars try to keep details of their love life private, Bilson's never been one to shy away from talking about her romantic interests on her podcast.\nIn a June 2022 episode, the Hart of Dixie alum\u00a0told her guest Aubrey Plaza that she and Hader had previously dated, which was a revelation to The White Lotus star despite the fact that the three actors had co-starred in the 2013 comedy The To-Do List.

But I remember the tension with Samaire and I, like, a little bit.\"Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagicLet's Talk About Sex, BabyGiven that her mother Janice is a sex therapist, Bilson has always had a comfort level with discussions others may find uncomfortable.\u00a0\n\"Growing up in a household that was so sex-positive and free and candid...definitely made me more obviously open talking about things,\"\u00a0she told Yahoo! Life's The Unwind series in July. \"These are the things women go through, and there's nothing connected to it that feels like, 'Oh, I shouldn't be talking about this.\"\nAnd it's why Bilson launched the Broad Ideas podcast with her best friend of 25 years, Olivia Allen, in 2022. On the show, she welcomes a variety of guests to discuss a range of broad topics, including sex, infidelity,\u00a0and mental health, free of filters or fake niceties.\n\"I'm a little more unhinged, but it's nice to be able to feel free with it,\" Bilson told E!

However, despite the similarities, cases for the original Pixel Watch won\u2019t support the Pixel Watch 2.  At a glance, and even on close inspection, the Pixel Watch 2 looks virtually identical to the original model. It has the same waterdrop display, the same overall size, just about everything. But, as it turns out, things are just different enough to break support for existing accessories. If you take a look at Amazon and search for Pixel Watch cases, you might see a trend among some brands that have changed their listings to say that the products are \u201cnot for Pixel Watch 2.\u201d Spigen, Caseology, and some others note the difference.  So, what\u2019s the problem? As it turns out, tweaks to the hardware on Pixel Watch 2, mainly the crown, cause most existing accessories from the original Pixel Watch to simply not be compatible. That is, if they involve the crown or button. It\u2019s such a minor change, that it\u2019s hard to see, but side by side you can see that the new crown is slightly bigger, and that the second button is also just a tiny bit different. We also noticed that, on the other side, what looks like a microphone cutout has been repositioned.  Basically, if you were hoping to score a case for the Pixel Watch 2, don\u2019t buy anything just yet. Given the speed at which those accessories arrived last year, you won\u2019t be waiting long.

More than 60,000 are still in the city\u2019s care.\nThe situation has consumed nearly all of Adams\u2019 energy and created a political crisis for the mayor \u2014 his once-close relationship with Biden has been sullied; the two haven\u2019t spoken in months.\nTaking international relations into his own hands, Adams set off on a whirlwind trip \u2014 with NYPD officers, top aides and reporters in tow \u2014 that will take him through Mexico, Ecuador and Colombia, including the dangerous Dari\u00e9n Gap, over the next several days.\nThe tour was shaping up to be a frenetic combination of fact-finding mission, public-service campaign and self-aggrandizement of his mayoral brand that included receiving an honorary degree in Puebla.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdams touted his foreign relations bona fides by citing several meetings with dignitaries during the recent United Nations General Assembly.\n|\nFernanda Pesce/AP Photo\n\n\n\n\nAdams \u2014 who in the past has brushed off criticism of his penchant for mixing religion with governance \u2014 touched down in Mexico City on Wednesday evening and headed to a holy site for Catholic pilgrims called the Basilica de Guadalupe, where he got an after-hours tour and spoke in sweeping terms about the scope of the solutions needed to stem the flow of migrants.\n\u201cThere are enough resources around the globe to address this issue,\u201d Adams said outside the deserted chapel grounds. \u201cI\u2019m going to do the best I can to send a message to all of the countries dealing with this that we have an obligation.\u201d\nImmigrant experts and Washington officials were skeptical that a junket by a U.S. mayor \u2014 paid partly with government funds for his security detail, personal money by his aides and by a nonprofit for his travel \u2014 would do much to advance those goals.\nFor one, the problems that have led to the increase in asylum-seekers are complex and have been building for years.\n\u201cA single trip by a politician will not dampen the flow,\u201d said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration attorney and professor at Cornell Law School. \u201cMayor Adams would do better to work cooperating with the Biden administration on this complex issue, rather than striking out on his own foreign policy pursuits.\u201d\nIndeed, many of the goals of Adams\u2019 trip \u2014 to liaison with Latin American leaders and deliver a message to migrants \u2014 are already done on a far larger scale by the federal government.\nThe Department of Homeland Security, according to a spokesperson, said the agency has been sending out messages to potential asylum-seekers in their own countries to combat misinformation promulgated by smugglers who present themselves as the best option to reach the southern border.\n\u201cThe mayor\u2019s biggest power isn\u2019t in Mexico: He has no federal or international relevance,\u201d said one Washington official who works on the migrant issue and was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the mayor\u2019s sojourn. \u201cHis gravitational force is strongest in Washington, and if he wants to make a point about Mexico, he should be doing it there.\u201d\nOn Thursday, meanwhile, the Biden administration announced the United States will again start deporting migrants to Venezuela to try to slow the flow from the troubled South American country \u2014 from where a large segment have come to New York. And a day earlier, the administration said it would resume construction in Texas of the Trump administration\u2019s proposed border wall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stop to meet with lawmakers was one of three Thursday where Adams (third from left) was honored by Mexican dignitaries.\n|\nFernanda Pesce/AP Photo\n\n\n\n\nStill, Adams\u2019 trip also drew criticism back home from Democrats and Republicans as a political stunt.\nCity Council Member Alexa Avil\u00e9s, a Democrat, called Adams\u2019 tour \u201cdevoid of any socio-economical context of why migrants are leaving their countries.\u201d\n\u201cOur city needs a lot right now, and we need somebody who\u2019s going to be focusing on finding solutions to the things we need now,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a tourist person to go to the Dari\u00e9n water gap who thinks he\u2019s going to convince individuals not to come to New York City. It\u2019s absurd.\u201d\nAdams, who also sat down with business leaders and met with a social service organization assisting migrants, is being accompanied on his trip in Mexico by Jorge Islas L\u00f3pez, the consul general of Mexico in New York City.\nThe mayor, pushing back against naysayers, touted his foreign relations bona fides by citing several meetings with dignitaries during the recent United Nations General Assembly.\n\u201cWe know we are considered an international city and the playbook for resolving this issue is one on a local level, a state level, a national level and an international level,\u201d Adams said in the ornate chambers of the Puebla state congress building.\nThe stop to meet with lawmakers was one of three Thursday where Adams was honored by Mexican dignitaries \u2014 creating a sharp rhetorical detour from the stated purpose of the trip.\nIn addition to the commendation bestowed upon him by Pueblan lawmakers, Adams was also granted an honorary degree from the Benem\u00e9rita Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Puebla, where he spoke from a wooden parapet to a crowd seated beneath arched porticos and hanging chandeliers about the need to turn academic theories into real-world solutions.\nAdams then raced over, escorted by a multimodal police detail, to a separate ceremony where he was given further awards by the Pueblo state governor and feted over dinner.\nThursday evening, Adams was slated to fly to Quito, Ecuador, where he plans to meet with government officials and chat with migrants. A stop Saturday includes a visit to the treacherous Dari\u00e9n Gap, which many asylum seekers pass through on their harrowing journey to the United States.\nAnd while the mayor hopes to convince some of the migrants he reaches in person or via local media to reconsider their trip to New York City, asylum-seekers already on the ground in the five boroughs did not give him good odds.\nEric Vega, 13, said he arrived from Ecuador with his two siblings and parents a month ago and disagreed that Adams\u2019 description of New York being full would have dissuaded him from making the trek.\n\u201cNew York is really nice,\u201d Vega said in an interview Wednesday outside of an emergency shelter for migrants in Queens. \u201cThey give you food. They give you clothes here in New York. They give you what you need. There\u2019s good people here.\u201d\nEmily Ngo and Jason Beeferman contributed to this report.", "filterCheck_Pass": {"checkBlockWord_title": true, "langEn_title": true, "lenCheck_title": true, "checkImageSize_title": true, "READY": true}, "keywords_article": ["New York City", "Mexico", "Ecuador", "Colombia", "Dari\u00e9n Gap"]}, "16": {"source_API": "NewsAPI", "mercury_worked": true, "query_name": "Top Headlines - US", "source_article": "PBS", "title_article": "WATCH LIVE: Winner of 2023 Nobel Peace Prize announced - PBS NewsHour", "description_article": "The 2023 recipient will be announced Friday, Oct. 6.", "url_article": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-live-winner-of-2023-nobel-peace-prize-announced", "urtToImage_article": "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2023/10/GettyImages-101976160-1024x687.jpg", "publishedAt_article": "2023-10-06T00:45:20Z", "content_article": "Imprisoned Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday in recognition of her tireless campaigning for women\u2019s rights and democracy and against the death penalty.\nWatch the event live in the player above.\nMohammadi, 51, has kept up her activism despite numerous arrests by Iranian authorities and spending years behind bars.\n\u201cThis prize is first and foremost a recognition of the very important work of a whole movement in Iran with its undisputed leader, Nargis Mohammadi,\u201d said Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee who announced the prize in Oslo.\nShe said the committee hopes the prize \u201cis an encouragement to continue the work in whichever form this movement finds to be fitting.\u201d She also urged Iran to release Mohammadi in time for the prize ceremony on Dec. 10.\nFor nearly all of Mohammadi\u2019s life, Iran has been governed by a Shiite theocracy headed by the country\u2019s supreme leader. While women hold jobs, academic positions and even government appointments, their lives can be tightly controlled.\nLaws require all women to at least wear a headscarf, or hijab, to cover their hair as a sign of piety. Iran and neighboring Afghanistan remain the only countries that mandate it.\nIn a statement to The New York Times, Mohammadi said the \u201cglobal support and recognition of my human rights advocacy makes me more resolved, more responsible, more passionate and more hopeful.\u201d\n\u201cI also hope this recognition makes Iranians protesting for change stronger and more organized,\u201d she added. \u201cVictory is near.\u201d\nMohammadi has been imprisoned 13 times and convicted five times, according to Reiss-Andersen. In total, she has been sentenced to 31 years in prison. Mohammadi\u2019s most recent incarceration began when she was detained in 2021 after she attended a memorial for a person killed in nationwide protests sparked by an increase in gasoline prices.\nShe has been held at Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin Prison, whose inmates include those with Western ties and political prisoners. Physical and sexual abuse of women in prisons, something Mohammadi has campaigned against both outside of and behind bars, remains endemic.\nMohammadi is the 19th woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize and the second Iranian woman, after human rights activist Shirin Ebadi won the award in 2003\nIt\u2019s the fifth time in the 122-year history of the awards that the peace prize has been given to someone who is in prison or under house arrest. Last year, the top human rights advocate in Belarus, Ales Bialiatski, was among the winners. He remains imprisoned.\nMohammadi was behind bars for the recent protests over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody. That sparked one of the most intense challenges ever to Iran\u2019s theocracy. More than 500 people were killed in a heavy security crackdown while over 22,000 others were arrested.\nFrom behind bars, she contributed an opinion piece for The New York Times.\n\u201cWhat the government may not understand is that the more of us they lock up, the stronger we become,\u201d she wrote.\nThere was no immediate reaction from Iranian state television and other state-controlled media. Some semiofficial news agencies acknowledged Mohammadi\u2019s win in online messages, citing foreign press reports.\nBefore being jailed, Mohammadi was vice president of the banned Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran. Ebadi, who Mohammadi is close to, founded the center.\nIn 2018, Mohammadi, an engineer, was awarded the Andrei Sakharov Prize. Earlier this year, PEN America, which advocates for freedom of speech, gave Mohammadi its PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award. The organization applauded her win.\nThe choice \u201cis a tribute to her courage and that of countless women and girls who have poured out into the streets of Iran and faced down one of the world\u2019s most brutal and stubborn regimes, risking their lives to demand their rights,\u201d PEN America CEO Suzanne Nossel said in a statement.\nThe Nobel Prizes carry a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor (about $1 million). Winners also receive an 18-carat gold medal and diploma at the award ceremonies in December.\nIn addition to Bialiatski, human rights activists from Ukraine and Russia also shared last year\u2019s prize, in what was seen as a strong rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin after his invasion of Ukraine.\nOther previous winners include Nelson Mandela, Barack Obama, Mikhail Gorbachev, Aung San Suu Kyi and the United Nations.\nUnlike the other Nobel prizes that are selected and announced in Stockholm, founder Alfred Nobel decreed that the peace prize be decided and awarded in Oslo by the five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee. The independent panel is appointed by the Norwegian parliament.\nThe peace prize was the fifth of this year\u2019s prizes to be announced. A day earlier, the Nobel committee awarded Norwegian writer Jon Fosse the prize for literature. On Wednesday, the chemistry prize went to U.S.-based scientists who study quantum dots \u2014 whose applications include electronics and medical imaging.\nThe physics prize went Tuesday to three scientists who gave us the first glimpse into the superfast world of spinning electrons.

Ron DeSantis on Thursday delivered some of the sharpest criticism of Donald Trump to date, blaming the former president for his own defeat in 2020 and suggesting his chief rival in the GOP nominating fight lacked the energy to lead the country once again.\n  \n\n  \n      What started as a campaign event to promote support from Florida sheriffs ended with DeSantis skewering Trump in a series of rejoinders that make clear his intentions to recast the race around the former president\u2019s perceived shortcomings. \n  \n\n  \n      In an unmistakable shot at Trump\u2019s age and stamina, DeSantis quipped, \u201cWe don\u2019t need any more presidents that have lost the zip on their fastball.\u201d He said the party\u2019s nomination shouldn\u2019t be a coronation, especially for \u201canybody that couldn\u2019t even stop Joe Biden.\u201d\n  \n\n  \n      Regarding the 2020 election, he said people were \u201cvoting against Trump,\u201d undercutting the ongoing lies about a stolen election from the former president and his supporters \u2013 including failed congressional candidate Laura Loomer, who heckled DeSantis from outside his Tampa event with a bullhorn that rattled aides as her voice carried into the venue.\n  \n\n  \n      \u201cLet\u2019s just be honest, he energized Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could have John Kennedy walk through the door right now and he wouldn\u2019t energize Democrats as much as Donald Trump does.\u201d \n  \n\n  \n      The remarks come as DeSantis has shifted to a more aggressive approach in recent weeks as the urgency to diminish Trump has intensified. \n  \n\n  \n      Still, the sharp-tongued attacks from DeSantis on Thursday were striking in what they signaled for the weeks ahead. DeSantis, who once fiercely defended and then attempted to ignore Trump, appears prepared to go full-throttle at his former ally to make up for his large polling deficit. \n  \n\n  \n      Democrats have already seized on the breakdown in their relationship. After DeSantis called Trump \u201cmissing in action\u201d at the debate and said the Trump administration\u2019s spending \u201cset the stage for the inflation,\u201d President Joe Biden shared a clip on social media, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n  \n\n  \n      The latest round of attacks were largely provoked by questions DeSantis faced during the Tampa event. One man who identified himself as a DeSantis supporter asked how the Florida governor will defeat a candidate who \u201cfills stadiums.\u201d \n  \n\n  \n      DeSantis quickly shot back: \u201cNot anymore.\u201d \n  \n\n  \n      \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: a voter that goes to 10 rallies, their vote counts the same as somebody that\u2019s unenthusiastic and then goes and votes. And we just have to understand that,\u201d he continued. \n  \n\n  \n      But DeSantis also took a shot without provocation at Trump\u2019s failed promise to build a wall at the southern border and make Mexico pay for it. DeSantis told the crowd he would finish what Trump could not.\n  \n\n  \n      DeSantis later questioned Trump\u2019s fundraising numbers \u2013 which the Trump campaign announced Wednesday just hours after DeSantis released his. The Trump campaign reported it brought in more than $45.5 million during the period that spanned July 1 to September 30, compared to the DeSantis campaign\u2019s $15 million. \n  \n\n  \n      Only $5 million of the DeSantis dollars can be spent toward the primary, while Trump has nearly $36 million designated for use in the primary, his campaign said. \n  \n\n  \n      Those figures cannot be independently verified until federal election reports are made public later this month. But DeSantis said he believes that the math will show he is still ahead. DeSantis has a super PAC that was seeded with nearly $83 million left over from his 2022 gubernatorial campaign.\n  \n\n  \n      Trump has continued to use his legal troubles to encourage donations from supporters. DeSantis encouraged people to look at how Trump is spending those contributions.\n  \n\n  \n      \u201cWhy is he raising that money? And where\u2019s that money going to?\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cIsn\u2019t it going to a lot of lawyers?\u201d", "filterCheck_Pass": {"checkBlockWord_title": true, "langEn_title": true, "lenCheck_title": true, "checkImageSize_title": true, "READY": true}, "keywords_article": ["Florida", "Ron DeSantis", "Donald Trump", "GOP"]}, "21": {"query_name": "US News (REDDIT)", "source_API": "reddit", "reddit_title": "77-year-old man from The Villages arrested after found with $1,800 worth of illegal erectile dysfunction pills", "reddit_body": "", "reddit_score": 17073, "reddit_id": "171e2ra", "reddit_comments_total": 1918, "reddit_created": 1696603260.0, "submission_url": "https://nbc-2.com/news/weird/2023/10/05/77-year-old-man-from-the-villages-arrested-after-found-with-1800-worth-of-illegal-erectile-dysfunction-pills/", "reddit_path": "https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/171e2ra/77yearold_man_from_the_villages_arrested_after/", "mercuryAPI_response": "200", "url_article": "https://nbc-2.com/news/2023/10/05/77-year-old-man-from-the-villages-arrested-after-found-with-1800-worth-of-illegal-erectile-dysfunction-pills/", "title_article": "77-year-old man from The Villages arrested after found with $1,800 worth of illegal erectile dysfunction pills", "description_article": "", "urtToImage_article": "https://nbc-2.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/villiages.jpg", "publishedAt_article": "2023-10-05T21:31:13.000Z", "content_article": "THE VILLAGES, Fla. \u2014 (WESH) A 77-year-old Florida man was arrested and accused of having thousands of dollars worth of illegal pills used to treat erectile dysfunction. Now, there\u2019s outrage in the community that he was arrested. The Villages, with homes sprawling through multiple Florida counties, is considered one of the largest retirement communities in the nation. It is a place where senior romances bloom like spring flowers. And a place where one particular prescription pill could be in high demand. The kind that treats erectile dysfunction. According to the feds, Reginald Kincer was allegedly willing to satisfy that demand. Kincer gave us a quick interview at his house in The Villages. \u201cThey are trying to do the right thing, and I\u2019m trying to do the right thing, too,\u201d he told NBC2 affiliate WESH 2 News. According to a news release, the 77-year-old had more than $1,800 worth of the pills that were off-brand stashed in his house. They were the pills he allegedly got \u201cwithout a prescription from a licensed doctor\u201d with plans to \u201credistribute the drugs in and outside of the state.\u201d Needless to say, Kincer has become somewhat of a folklore legend in The Villages, with one-liners coming faster than professional comics can deliver. \u201cIt won\u2019t hold up in court,\u201d one local man said.\u201cA man is just trying to do a girl a favor,\u201d a local woman said. \u201cI hope they don\u2019t release any names.

Manuel Esteban Paez Ter\u00e1n, who went by \"Tortuguita\" and used they/them pronouns, was shot and killed by six Georgia State Troopers on Jan. 18 as officers raided campgrounds occupied by environmental demonstrators who had allegedly been camping out for months to protest the development of the training center, dubbed \"Cop City\" by critics. After months of investigating, the Stone Mountain Circuit District Attorney\u2019s Office says the troopers' use of lethal force was \"objectively reasonable under the circumstances of the case.\" In their report, officials say the troopers spoke with Tortuguita, who refused to leave and zipped up the tent in which they were living. After an officer fired pepper balls at the tents, officials say that the environmental activist fired multiple shots - hitting Georgia State Patrol Trooper Jerry Parrish below his armor plate and above his belt on his right side and lodging the bullet in his spine. The troopers then returned fire, hitting and killing Tortuguita. In a new report released Friday, the Stone Mountain Circuit District Attorney's Office says they found that the troopers \"did not act with any criminal intent\" due to the circumstances and said it was \"not feasible\" for the troopers to issue a warning before firing.\u00a0 Family of Manual Taran react to DA's findings Word that the Stone Mountain Judicial Circuit DA will not file charges against the six state troopers who shot and killed reached the 26-year-old's mother. \"There is nothing we can believe and understand. So many stories. I don't believe what they are saying,\u00a0until we have a real investigation,\" mom Belkis Teran said.\u00a0 His mother is still calling for an independent investigation. \"Why so much cruelty? To kill one person with one or two bullets is enough. 57 wounds, 13 bullets apparently, so why?\" his mom questioned. Attorneys for The Toran family have asked for full transparency, now that the investigation is over. \"To continue to withhold it and withhold evidence and deny this family the ability to go through the evidence for themselves is incredibly painful,\" attorney Jeff Filipovits emphasized. The Toran family would like for an independent agency to look at the facts of the case.\u00a0 What the family and official autopsy reveal Protestors and Tortuguita's family have questioned claims that the activist fired first, saying that their independent autopsy showed their hands were raised and they were facing multiple troopers during the time of the shooting. \"Both Manuel\u2019s left and right hands show exit wounds in both palms. The autopsy further reveals that Manuel was most probably in a seated position, cross-legged when killed,\" the family\u2019s attorney expressed in March. According to the lawyers, the private autopsy revealed that Tortuguita had been shot 14 separate times in various locations, including the head through their right eye, left upper chest, abdomen, arms and legs. The wounds indicated that their arm and hand were raised with the palm facing forward during the shooting, the attorneys said.   The DeKalb County Medcial Examers's \u00a0autopsy, which released to the public the month after, showed now gunpowder residue on the activist's hands. An analysis by the GBI crime lab disputed that report, saying that its findings \"revealed the presence of particles characteristic of gunshot primer residue.\" The DeKalb autopsy also said that Tortuguita's body had at least 57 gunshot wounds to their head, torso, and extremities including the hands and right foot. The cause of death was ruled to be multiple gunshot wounds. During the processing of the scene, officials say they found a Smith and Wesson 9 m.m. handgun and magazines with ammunition that were later determined to have been purchased by Tortuguita from a sporting goods store in Acworth in 2020.\u00a0 Family responds to decision to not charge troopers In response to the announcement that the troopers will not be charged, Tortuguita's family called the prosecutor's decision \"a rubber stamp of the GBI's version of events without any critical analysis.\" While the family called the lack of charge's disappointing, they criticized the government's choice to not release the investigation file, which they say prevents them from independently investigating the activist's death. We have waited eight months for the truth. We are in pain. We want to hear the interviews. We want our experts to review the lab tests. We want our questions answered. This report does not answer our questions,\" Tortuguita's mother Belkis Teran said in a statement. \"How long must we wait?\"\u00a0 Response to Tortuguita's death Tortuguita\u2019s death and their dedication to opposing the training center vaulted the \"Stop Cop City\" movement onto the national and international stage, with leftist activists from across the country holding vigils and prompting some to travel and join the protest movement that began in 2021. They say officers at the 85-acre center would be trained to become more militarized and quell dissent, all while hundreds of trees are cut down, damaging the climate and flood mitigation in a poor, majority-Black neighborhood. A few protests have turned violent, including one in March when more than 150 masked activists left a nearby music festival and stormed the proposed site of the training center, setting fire to construction equipment and throwing rocks at retreating law enforcement officers. Georgia prosecutors indicted 61 people on RICO charges in connection with protests, calling the defendants \"militant anarchists\" who are accused of committing arson and damaging property in metro Atlanta. The Atlanta City Council approved building the proposed $90 million Atlanta Public Safety Training Center in 2021, saying a state-of-the-art campus would replace substandard offerings and boost police morale, which is beset by hiring and retention struggles in the wake of violent protests against racial injustice that roiled the city after George Floyd was killed by police in 2020. Currently, a petition signed by more than 116,000 Atlanta residents in the attempt to put the training center up to a vote remains in limbo after officials say it was submitted past the deadline.

In a Friday morning statement, Helena Police Department Assistant Chief Corey Bailey said officers responded to reports of gunshot in the neighborhood at 5:44 p.m. and were subsequently called by a business informing them that someone had shot \u201cthe front entry of their business.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt was determined that an individual had walked up to the front of the business and fired two rounds from a shotgun. There were no injuries reported and the shots were not directed towards anyone,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOfficers and detectives were able to develop suspect information and the case is active.\u201d\n  Bailey later confirmed to Montana Free Press that no suspects are in custody at this time. He declined to say whether officers and detectives have video surveillance footage of the shooter from around the building\u2019s premises.

She declined to say whether anyone was in the building at the time of the incident. \u201cLast evening after closing, the exterior of Planned Parenthood of Montana\u2019s Helena location was shot at.

Our doors will remain open and Planned Parenthood of Montana will never step back from providing care in a safe, supportive environment that Montanans rely on and trust.\u201d On Thursday evening, hours after the shooting took place, a large pink sign was attached to the window next to the clinic\u2019s entrance, reading \u201cThese doors stay open.\u201d Sullivan would not confirm whether the sign was covering where shots entered the building, citing the ongoing investigation.\u00a0 The shooting is the first report in recent years of a violent attack on an abortion clinic in Montana. In 2015, a man was sentenced to five years in state prison for vandalizing the All Families Healthcare clinic in Kalispell, forcing the Flathead Valley\u2019s only abortion provider to close her practice. In 1993, Blue Mountain Clinic in Missoula was firebombed by an anti-abortion activist and later rebuilt.\u00a0 Violence and threats against abortion providers \u2014 as well as against anti-abortion groups and pregnancy resource centers \u2014 have ticked up nationwide in recent years. More than two dozen criminal cases are listed on the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s website tracking prosecutions of \u201cviolence and other conduct\u201d aimed at reproductive health care providers over the last decade.\u00a0 Pre-viability abortion has remained legal in Montana in the wake of the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade because of the state Constitution\u2019s right to privacy and the Montana Supreme Court\u2019s 1999 ruling in Armstrong v. State. Laws passed by Republican legislators and signed by Gov. Greg Gianforte to restrict abortion at all stages of pregnacy and add other requirements for abortion providers have been enjoined in court while litigation continues. \n     This fall, state Superintendent Elsie Arntzen signed a textbook dealer agreement with Prager University, a conservative-leaning nonprofit that\u2019s generating national controversy over its lessons on climate change, slavery and gender.", "article_author": "None", "source_article": "Montana Free Press", "filterCheck_Pass": {"checkBlockWord_title": true, "langEn_title": true, "lenCheck_title": true, "checkImageSize_title": true, "READY": true}, "keywords_article": []}, "24": {"query_name": "US News (REDDIT)", "source_API": "reddit", "reddit_title": "New York subway shooter Frank James sentenced to 10 life terms plus 10 years in prison", "reddit_body": "", "reddit_score": 5470, "reddit_id": "171chsh", "reddit_comments_total": 347, "reddit_created": 1696599337.0, "submission_url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/05/us/new-york-subway-shooter-sentencing/index.html", "reddit_path": "https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/171chsh/new_york_subway_shooter_frank_james_sentenced_to/", "mercuryAPI_response": "200", "url_article": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/05/us/new-york-subway-shooter-sentencing/index.html", "title_article": "New York subway shooter Frank James sentenced to 10 life terms plus 10 years in prison", "description_article": "", "urtToImage_article": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231005080855-frank-james-subway-shooting-arrest-2022-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "publishedAt_article": "2023-10-05T14:30:40.000Z", "content_article": "The man who set off a smoke bomb and opened fire on a crowded New York City subway train last year, injuring 29 people but miraculously killing none, was sentenced Thursday to 10 concurrent life terms plus a 10-year consecutive term in prison.\n  \n\n  \n      Frank James pleaded guilty in January in federal court to 10 counts of committing a terrorist attack or other violence against a mass transportation vehicle and an additional firearms charge in connection to the April 2022 attack.\n  \n\n  \n      Prosecutors had asked the judge for a life sentence, while the shooter\u2019s attorneys asked for 18 years. \n  \n\n  \n      James, who was 62 at the time, put on a gas mask, set off a smoke device and fired a handgun at least 33 times on a Manhattan-bound N subway train heading through Brooklyn\u2019s Sunset Park neighborhood during a weekday morning commute, prosecutors have said. \n  \n\n  \n\n\n  \n      The smoke device caused passengers to scramble to one end of the subway car, making them easier targets for James, prosecutors said.

The findings raise questions about whether the panel is looking out for Americans\u2019 health or corporate profits, and \u201cerodes confidence in dietary guidelines\u201d, said Gary Ruskin of US Right to Know.\u201cMillions of Americans\u2019 lives are affected by this report and it\u2019s crucial that the report tell the truth to American people and it\u2019s not degraded into another sales pitch for big food and big pharma,\u201d he said.The panel, called the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DAGC), makes the recommendations to the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department Of Health and Human Services (HHS). The guidelines are considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d for dietary advice in the US and around the world, and influence which foods are served in institutional settings such as schools, hospitals and military facilities.They inform how healthcare professionals and nutritionists treat people, and influence how federal food aid is distributed, nutrition labeling, and how food products are formulated.\u201cThe guidelines affect the entire US food system quite strongly, \u201c Ruskin said.The agriculture and health departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment.US Right to Know scoured public records dating back five years for conflicts of interest among the 20 panel members. In addition to the nine it found with \u201chigh-risk conflicts of interest\u201d and connections to the food and drug industry, it found four more members who have possible conflicts of interest. It applauded the agencies for appointing seven members who did not appear to have any conflicts.At least four panelists have connections to at least two companies each among Abbott, Novo Nordisk, the National Dairy Council, Eli Lilly and Weight Watchers International. One panel member has received about $240,000 in grant funding from Eli Lilly.Industry attempts to place allies on advisory panels such as the dietary committee are not new. US Right to Know has co-authored 15 peer-reviewed studies revealing how the food and pharmaceutical industries attempt to shape public opinion, scientific research and government policy.Earlier this year, it detailed how industry-linked groups appear to have influenced the World Health Organization\u2019s decision to downplay cancer risks posed by aspartame.\u201cThe last thing that a food or pharmaceutical company wants to have is a federal agency that says \u2018Don\u2019t buy this stuff, don\u2019t buy those products,\u2019\u201d Raskin said. \u201cThat could potentially be a mortal threat to companies\u2019 profit stream. So they are extremely attuned and sensitive to that possibility, and lobby in lots of ways to make sure that never happens.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The disclosures were a response to pressure from public health advocates and the Republican senator Chuck Grassley, who Ruskin said sent a letter to the agencies urging them to be transparent about panel members\u2019 potential conflicts of interest.But the disclosures only covered the last year, were aggregated and did not identify each individual member\u2019s conflicts, and Ruskin characterized the disclosures as \u201can affront to the public\u201d.The new report aims to \u201cfill in the gaps\u201d left by the government\u2019s vague disclosures.The agriculture and health departments can overrule the panel\u2019s recommendations and has done so in the past, and Congress has also gotten involved. US Right to Know made a range of recommendations, among them a requirement for stronger disclosures, notification of appointees prior to appointment and an expansion of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act \u2013 which requires doctors to report money received from drug companies \u2013 to cover the nutrition field.The easiest step, however, would be for the agencies not to appoint people with high-risk conflicts of interest.\u201cThis is an avoidable problem,\u201d Ruskin said. \u201cIt would be far better for public health if they picked experts with no conflict of interest.

Bryan, who most recently served as GM of the Ottawa Senators and passed away from colon cancer in 2017, had a remarkable 35-year career in coaching and management. Terry played for Philadelphia, Washington and Detroit before moving behind the bench for the Capitals, Flyers, Panthers and Kings.Then whenever Teena's uncles would return home during the offseasons, the business became a gathering spot of sorts for the family.\"I was supposed to be working, but we'd stand around all summer and just talk hockey,\" Teena said with a laugh. \"The lessons I learned there and just the relational side of this business\u2026 knowing how to talk to people and knowing just how to really understand the culture of team sport and what it takes\u2026 I learned all of that back then from them.\"With the sport in her blood, Murray always had a lot of interest in eventually getting back to hockey during her career on the performance side of sports that's spanned over 20 of them - and an incredible opportunity to do just that has come with the Penguins.Murray was recently named the team's Senior Vice President of Integrated Performance, where she will oversee the hockey operations' strength and conditioning staff, rehabilitation, sports science and medical staff and report directly to general manager Ron Hextall.\"This opportunity to lead the growth and development of more of an integrated performance team at this time was one that I just felt I couldn't pass up, with the championship culture that's already in place,\" said Murray, who has spent the past four seasons as vice president of health and performance for the NBA's Sacramento Kings.\"I have known Ron for quite some time, I've known of (president of hockey operations Brian Burke) for a long time, and I'm excited about their vision and what they're doing there. I just feel like the time was right.\"Murray got started on her particular path in sports somewhat organically. As an athlete herself, she had always enjoying being in the weight room while playing college basketball and studying kinesiology at Wilfrid Laurier University in Canada.When Murray arrived at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro to pursue her master's degree in exercise physiology and sports nutrition, she got an assistantship with the softball team - where she was able to take advantage of the knowledge she had built up through her own experiences.\"They had this great weight room, but they had no strength coach,\" Murray said. \"So I just started taking our team in there as part of their training, and I started writing the program.\"That started a ripple effect, which led to the basketball and volleyball coaches asking if she could put together programs for their teams as well. Murray loved that type of work so much that she got her strength and conditioning certification, and as she was finishing her degree, realized she wanted to continue working with different sports and athletes on the performance side.\"I was really into my own training and nutrition and all of these things, and I just kind of took my passion, my hobby, and made it a career,\" she said.Murray now has over 25 years of experience working with professional and collegiate teams. Prior to her time in Sacramento, Murray spent 14 years at the University of Louisville as the director of sports performance, where she built an NCAA-leading high-performance sport program that served 21 Division I Top-25 sports.She has also worked as either a strength and conditioning coach or consultant for various teams/organizations throughout her professional career. On the hockey side, that includes the Anaheim Ducks, Hartford Wolfpack and the Panthers. Murray also won two World Championship gold medals, as well as a silver medal at the 2010 Olympic Games, with Team USA - where she served as the first-ever Director of Performance for the U.S. Women's National and Olympic hockey teams from 2006-10.\"A lot of the players had been trying to find their own strength coaches wherever they were going to school or wherever they were working, and so it was the first time that USA Hockey brought someone on board as the director of performance to manage all aspects of training and development,\" Murray said. \"I had a chance to spend four years building this program.\"That was a transformative experience for Murray, as not only did she have the opportunity to work closely with elite athletes - but also with talented people who specialized in areas like biomechanics, physiology and other related spaces at the Olympic Training Centers in Lake Placid and Colorado Springs. After returning to Louisville following the Vancouver Games, Murray was inspired to start implementing that high-performance approach with the athletes there.\"Over time, we were able to add nutrition and psychology and begin adding analytics,\" Murray said. \"We built a really impressive performance analytics department at Louisville, and started integrating data across all teams. So that's I guess kind of where these philosophies, if you will, were birthed.\"Murray has become known for pioneering that type of high-performance approach in elite sport. Instead of the traditional setup where all of the different silos, like medical and strength and conditioning, can get isolated from each other, Murray champions an interdisciplinary approach where everyone is fully integrated and interconnected, with systems that drive such collaboration.\"We work very collaboratively to individualize everything that we do for each player,\" Murray said. \"There's no doubt it's difficult to do that in a team sport, but it's very possible. And we certainly want to use data to inform some of the decision-making to better manage the care and performance of every player.\"Throughout Murray's entire life, she's grown used to being the only female, whether it was playing boys' hockey as a kid or as she progressed throughout her career. When she first arrived in Sacramento, it was just her and one administrative assistant upstairs, and that was it. But they've since diversified, as Murray was able to hire two women onto her staff, and she's proud to play a part in continuing the growing visibility of women in sports.\"There's no doubt I believe in lifting as you rise, and so every time I've had a chance to move into more of a management role, a leadership role, I make it a high priority to try to create opportunities for other females,\" Murray said.And now, she can't wait to get started in the one she has in front of her.\"I'm thrilled,\" Murray said. \"I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity. Really, really excited to be joining Burkie and Hexy, and can't wait to get started.\"", "filterCheck_Pass": {"checkBlockWord_title": true, "langEn_title": true, "lenCheck_title": true, "checkImageSize_title": true, "READY": true}, "keywords_article": ["Teena Murray", "Shawville", "Quebec", "Bill"]}, "30": {"source_API": "bing", "mercury_worked": false, "query_name": "Business Search - US - Bing", "source_article": "Business Standard", "source_icon": "https://www.bing.com/th?id=ODF.6yYEGE61ig4jYI6NTUmjjg&pid=news", "title_article": "Untenable, bogus: NewsClick rejects allegations levelled in FIR against it", "description_article": "The NewsClick portal has rejected as untenable and bogus allegations levelled in a Delhi Police FIR against it, and said the proceedings initiated are \"nothing but a blatant attempt to muzzle the free and independent press in India\".", "url_article": "https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/untenable-bogus-newsclick-rejects-allegations-levelled-in-fir-against-it-123100700310_1.html", "urtToImage_article": "https://www.bing.com/th?id=OVFT.P1-bzNwo3hXdpzGQuXtL9C", "publishedAt_article": "2023-10-07T08:25:00.0000000Z", "content_article": "https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/untenable-bogus-newsclick-rejects-allegations-levelled-in-fir-against-it-123100700310_1.html", "filterCheck_Pass": {"checkBlockWord_title": true, "langEn_title": true, "lenCheck_title": true, "checkImageSize_title": true, "READY": true}, "keywords_article": ["NewsClick", "Delhi", "India"]}, "31": {"source_API": "bing", "mercury_worked": true, "query_name": "Business Search - US - Bing", "source_article": "BBC", "source_icon": "https://www.bing.com/th?id=ODF.k3N4DqozNjgK376rAnFmsA&pid=news", "title_article": "Horncastle teenager creates Surprise Shirts football kit empire from bedroom", "description_article": "A teenager who started a business from his bedroom when he was 16 has become so successful he now employs his mum and dad.

He said he had an eye for outrageous design, which was why one of his favourite shirts was Forward Madison FC's 'DripKit' from 2020, which he said was \"one of the craziest shirts I've ever seen\".However, he said equally good was Terengganu FC's 2021 3rd shirt, which he described as \"a crazy pattern with a stunning colour palette\".\"I think black and gold work perfectly together on lots of football shirts and the turquoise just tops it off. \"Also it's one of the first shirts I've ever seen with an iridescent badge, which is something Chelsea have now utilised on their new home shirt,\" he said.Image source, Louis JonesImage caption, Mr Jones helped design his favourite football shirt which features an outline of the island of AnguillaBut Mr Jones said one shirt stood head and shoulders above the rest.

Mr Schumer \"will focus on the need for reciprocity in China for US businesses that will level the playing field for American workers, as well as on maintaining US leadership in advanced technologies for national security\", his office said.\nThe trip follows visits by a series of high-level Biden administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in August. \nThe group of six senators, co-led by Republican Mike Crapo, will meet government and business leaders in the three countries they are visiting, and from US companies operating in the region. Other senators on the trip include Republicans Bill Cassidy and John Kennedy and Democrats Maggie Hassan and Jon Ossoff. The group landed at Shanghai's Pudong airport at 2pm (0600 GMT).  China welcomes Mr Schumer's visit and hopes it will deepen the US Senate's \"objective\" understanding of China and facilitate dialogue between the nations' legislative agencies, China's foreign ministry said this week.\nThe Biden administration has placed curbs on chip exports to China, saying they aim to deny it access to advanced technology that could further military advancements or rights abuses. China hit back with accusations of economic coercion. \nMs Raimondo said in August that US companies had complained to her that China has become \"uninvestable\", pointing to fines, raids and other actions that made it risky to do business there. \n\"For US business in many cases, patience is running thin, and it's time for action,\" she said.

No wonder Alone in the Dark ran scared from this release window. It\u2019s been another downer of a week, with layoff news coming from Telltale Games, Team 17 and Naughty Dog. We\u2019ve also heard news that several former Ubisoft executives have been detained by French police, who are investigating claims of sexual assault and harassment at the company (details of which broke in several 2020 reports). Even as we celebrate the deluge of fantastic games this month, it pays for us to also remember the people who made them \u2014 many of whom no longer have jobs. In personal news, I\u2019ll be playing more of Spider-Man 2 as we prep for the GamesBeat review \u2014 but I am definitely going to make time for Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage. This series and I have so much history that I feel obligated to make space for it in my life no matter what.

Drug and staffing shortages haven\u2019t gone away. Stores are starting their busiest time of year as customers look for help with colds and the flu. And this fall, pharmacists are dealing with a new vaccine and the start of insurance coverage for COVID-19 shots.Some drugstores have addressed their challenges by adding employees at busy hours. But experts say many pharmacies, particularly the big chains, still don\u2019t have enough workers behind the counter.Chris Adkins said he left his job as a pharmacist with a major drugstore chain a couple years ago because of the stress. Aside from filling and checking prescriptions, Adkins routinely answered the phone, ran the register and stocked pharmacy shelves.\u201cI just didn\u2019t have time for the patients,\u201d he said. \u201cI am OK working hard and working long hours, but I just felt like I was not doing a good job as a pharmacist.\u201dIn recent years, drugstores have struggled to fill open pharmacist and pharmacy technician positions, even as many have raised pay and dangled signing bonuses.Larger drugstore chains often operate stores with only one pharmacist on duty per shift, said Richard Dang, an assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California. That kind of thin staffing can make it hard to recruit employees. \u201cI think that many pharmacists in the profession are hesitant to work for a company where they don\u2019t feel supported,\u201d said Dang, a former president of the California Pharmacists Association.Customers have noticed.John Staed, of Pelham, Alabama, said a CVS pharmacist gave him the wrong prescription about a decade ago: the pills were a different color than usual. He worries the chances for another mistake could increase as pharmacists take on more work.\u201cThese pharmacists always look stressed,\u201d he said.A CVS spokeswoman said the company is focused on addressing concerns raised by its pharmacists and has taken several actions, including \u201cproviding additional pharmacy resources\u201d in markets that need support. She declined to say how many pharmacists or technicians the company has hired. Former Walgreens CEO Rosalind Brewer said in late June that the company had added more than 1,000 pharmacists in the second quarter, but was running into a shortage of job candidates. Walgreens is adding processing centers around the country to ease some of the prescription workload for its stores. Brewer, who left in late August, also said the company was limiting hours at 1,100 pharmacies, or about 12% of its U.S. locations. That was down from 1,600 earlier this year, but a company executive has said it doesn't expect to return all pharmacies to normal operating hours by year's end. Labor strife and staffing shortages in health care are not isolated to drugstores, as the recent Kaiser Permanente strike shows.But drugstores have some additional challenges in the fall. Many customers come to them for vaccines for COVID-19, flu and pneumonia. Plus, federal officials have approved a new shot for people ages 60 and older for a virus called RSV.All told, CVS touts in a pharmacy counter brochure that the company can offer more than 15 vaccines to customers. Ongoing drug shortages also have kept pharmacy workers on the phone more.Jonathan Marquess said one of his drugstores fielded 100 questions one day last fall about the antibiotic amoxicillin and the attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder treatment Adderall, two drugs in short supply.Marquess runs several independent pharmacies in Georgia and serves on the National Community Pharmacists Association board. He has done a few things to help his stores adapt to the extra workload, he said, including training all employees to answer basic questions about vaccines. Marquess also adds extra staff when he knows they will have an influx of customers, like when a nearby company sends its employees over for vaccines. \u201cWe learned from our experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cTraining your entire staff is very, very important.\u201dPharmacists say customers aren't powerless and can help things run smoothly.People should bring all their insurance cards to vaccine appointments, especially since insurance coverage is new for the COVID-19 shots, Marquess said.Dang said customers should avoid showing up right after pharmacies reopen from a lunch break or just before they close, times when pharmacists and technicians are especially busy.Making appointments for vaccines gives pharmacy workers a better sense for their workload. Calling several days in advance for a prescription refill also helps, said Jen Cocohoba, a pharmacy professor at University of California San Francisco.\u201cThat tiny piece of control can help, because there\u2019s so many things you cannot predict when you\u2019re inside the community pharmacy,\u201d Cocohoba said.___ AP Business Writer Josh Funk contributed to this report.", "filterCheck_Pass": {"checkBlockWord_title": true, "langEn_title": true, "lenCheck_title": true, "checkImageSize_title": true, "READY": true}, "keywords_article": ["U.S."]}, "35": {"source_API": "bing", "mercury_worked": true, "query_name": "Business Search - US - Bing", "source_article": "Business Insider", "source_icon": "https://www.bing.com/th?id=ODF.LrIq_5vxtu4ONs5zIW54FA&pid=news", "title_article": "Bitcoin mining without mining equipment, CGMD miner opens contract trading", "description_article": "CGMD miner opens contract trading.London, United Kingdom - October 7, 2023 \u2014 As more players enter the cryptocurrency space, mining becomes", "url_article": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/bitcoin-mining-without-mining-equipment-cgmd-miner-opens-contract-trading-1032685717", "urtToImage_article": "https://storage.googleapis.com/mmstudio-images/gallery/0Qs0EITqVZabcNzobJLcG7NxPF53/1696574874311-0.jpg", "publishedAt_article": "2023-10-07T08:14:00.0000000Z", "content_article": "CGMD miner opens contract trading.London, United Kingdom - October 7, 2023  \u2014 As more players enter the cryptocurrency space, mining becomes more complex and requires more computing power.

So Russia attempts to obscure the real source of the money by using intermediary banks.\u00a0The purchases, Verkhniatskyi said, are brokered by networks of shell companies, which are often covers for Russian intelligence, These firms usually buy the sanctioned goods from trading firms or retailers in bulk he said.Countries like Kazakhstan and Armenia, with traditionally close ties to Russia and weaker business laws, are used as bases for the shell companies.\u00a0Verkhniatskyi described the shell companies as \"sleeping bears\" some of which were set up before the invasion and were ready to activate once Western sanctions began to bite.Banks dealing in dollars, the world's default currency, in theory have to comply with American sanctions or face reprisals from the US government.But Kremlin agents have other options available that don't involve bank transfers that could trigger such checks, Verkhniatskyi said.\u00a0Some shell company agents hand over suitcases full of cash to suppliers or other valuables.\"There is also information on Russians using diamonds as payment methods for sanctioned goods,\" Verkhniatskyi said, citing Ukrainian government sources.\u00a0His claims are backed by a recent report by the UK's Serious Organised Crime & Anti-Corruption Evidence group. It found that the Kremlin's illicit cash flows are not just funding its tech procurement programs, but also disinformation campaigns and militant groups.\"Illicit finance is now an integral part of Russia's foreign and security policy,\" wrote Professor David Lewis from the University of Exeter in the study. \"It is also critical to the Russian military and security services, enabling illicit defence supply chains, facilitating military deployments overseas, and funding a growing array of parastate military units.\"But Russia lacks the capacity to buy the large numbers of banned tech items it needs through cash handovers alone, meaning it remains vulnerable to attempts to restrict the flow of Kremlin money through banks.Blacklisting Russia\u00a0Verkhniatskyi said a vital step would be Russia on the blacklist of the Financial Action Task Force blacklist, an inter-governmental organization meant to stop financial wrongdoing. The move effectively isolates a country from the world's banking systems.\u00a0The FATF briefly suspended Russia in the wake of the Ukraine invasion, a largely symbolic move meaning it was restricted from involvement at a leadership level.But it has so far hesitated in taking the more serious step of blacklisting Russia, amid concerns it could impact the neutrality of the FATF, and might not be effective.\u00a0Only three countries were blacklisted as of October 2023: North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar. A larger \"grey list\" of more than 25 countries also does not feature RussiaBut Verkhniatskyi dismissed these concerns, and said that not punishing Russia was doing more damage to the institution's credibility.\u00a0\"I think that the authority of FATF is undermined when they sit at the same table with the criminal state and keep on you know, working as normal,\" he said.The FATF did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider.", "filterCheck_Pass": {"checkBlockWord_title": true, "langEn_title": true, "lenCheck_title": true, "checkImageSize_title": true, "READY": true}, "keywords_article": ["Kremlin"]}, "37": {"source_API": "NewsAPI", "mercury_worked": true, "query_name": "Top Headlines - US", "source_article": "The Washington Post", "title_article": "Russia-Ukraine war news: Russian missile attack on village of Hroza kills at least 51 - The Washington Post", "description_article": "The Russian attack on a grocery store in the village of Hroza, near Kharkiv, killed at least 51 and was one of the war\u2019s deadliest missile strikes.", "url_article": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/06/russia-ukraine-war-news-hroza/", "urtToImage_article": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WB7P56QCMEQ5RKKBSEKF4PZ6VU_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440", "publishedAt_article": "2023-10-06T06:17:01Z", "content_article": "HROZA, Ukraine \u2014 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described a devastating Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian village of Hroza as proof of Russia\u2019s \u201cabsolute evil.\u201d He said Russian forces \u201ccouldn\u2019t have been unaware of where they were striking.\u201d The attack Thursday killed at least 52 people and was one of the war\u2019s deadliest missile strikes.Several people in the village in the Kharkiv region told The Washington Post on Friday that they suspected a Russian sympathizer living among them had informed the Russian military that a gathering for a fallen Ukrainian soldier would be held at a cafe, which was in the building struck in the attack.\u201cThis is not a coincidence,\u201d Serhiy Pletinka, 34, a soldier who was home on leave from the southern front visiting his parents when the strike occurred, told The Post. He then dug through the rubble, pulling out scores of people he grew up with.\u201cWhat else could it be?\u201d said Lyuba Savchenko, 63, when asked whether she, too, thought a local collaborator informed Russian forces about the funeral reception. Her sister and four of her cousins were killed. The Post could not immediately verify the claims, but fury and suspicion were rife Friday as family members speculated about who might have targeted the gathering. Hroza was formerly occupied by Russian forces until a surprise Ukrainian counteroffensive liberated it last year. Some villagers remain loyal to Russia, many residents said.Here\u2019s the latest on the war and its ripple effects across the globe.Several relatives of the fallen Ukrainian soldier were killed in the attack on Hroza, including his widow. Two more artillery shells struck near the village Friday, as workers with excavators arrived to clear out trees to make space in the cemetery for the 52 fatalities \u2014 around one-sixth of the population of the village.All of the victims were sent to a morgue in the regional capital, Kharkiv, which looked like the scene of a massacre Friday as dozens of employees sorted the bodies. The workers recovered the body of a boy, Ivan, who appeared to be the only child killed in the Hroza attack. Post reporters at the scene witnessed the body of only one person wearing a uniform. The morgue workers said they had seen no evidence of multiple military personnel among the dead \u2014 despite Moscow\u2019s claims that Russia attacks only military targets. The United Nations, citing Ukrainian authorities, said one soldier who was attending his father\u2019s funeral was among the dead.The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has identified 35 of those killed in the attack on Hroza, including 19 women, 15 men and an 8-year-old boy, a U.N. spokeswoman said Friday. The U.N. high commissioner for human rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, deployed a field team to the site to speak to survivors and gather more information about the attack, spokeswoman Liz Throssell said in a statement.The Hroza attack is \u201cincredibly horrifying for the people of Ukraine,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. She said the Russian attack showed why the United States should continue to support Ukraine. Imagine \u201cjust walking to the grocery store with your kids, trying to figure out what is it that you\u2019re going to make for dinner, and you see an explosion happen where bodies are everywhere,\u201d she said.A separate strike in the same region Friday killed a 10-year-old child and his grandmother, according to a local official. Oleg Synyehubov, head of the Kharkiv regional administration, wrote on Telegram that 30 others were injured in the attack on the city of Kharkiv, including an 11-month-old child.Moldova\u2019s pro-Western president said the Wagner Group was seeking to mount a coup against her. \u201cThe information that we have is that it was a plan prepared by [Prigozhin\u2019s] team,\u201d Maia Sandu said in an interview with the Financial Times published Friday. The Post previously reported on a trove of documents that showed how Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) had funneled tens of millions of dollars into the country to cultivate a network of politicians who would be more favorable to Russia.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that any Russian decision to revoke its ratification of a nuclear test ban treaty with the United States would \u201cnot constitute a statement of intention to conduct nuclear tests.\u201d On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia could revoke its own ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which Washington has signed but not ratified, while the speaker of Russia\u2019s lower house said Friday that lawmakers would consider the decision next week.Hand grenade fragments were found in the bodies of Wagner Group mercenary leader Yevgeniy Prigozhin and his deputies, who died in a plane crash in August, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in remarks Thursday, citing the results of a Russian investigation. The wreckage showed no \u201cexternal impact\u201d on the aircraft, he said, in an apparent denial that the Kremlin had ordered the outspoken mercenary leader\u2019s plane shot down. Western analysts say Putin probably ordered Prigozhin\u2019s death.President Biden is preparing a \u201cmajor speech\u201d on Ukraine, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. Biden has acknowledged concern that disarray in Congress in the wake of the ouster of Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) from the House speakership could impede future U.S. aid to Ukraine, telling reporters earlier this week: \u201cIt does worry me.\u201dRussia has successfully tested an experimental nuclear-powered cruise missile, Putin said. The missile, known as the Burevestnik in Russia and as Skyfall by NATO, is believed to be able to carry a nuclear warhead and can fly farther and for longer periods than other missiles because of its nuclear propulsion, the AP reported. Putin first mentioned the weapon in 2018.Russia launched drone attacks against Ukraine, damaging port infrastructure in the south, Ukraine said Friday. Odessa regional governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram that one attack damaged a grain silo and caused a fire, which was extinguished. Ukraine\u2019s military, meanwhile, wrote on Facebook that air defenses shot down 25 of 33 Russian drones that targeted six regions across the country. The Post was not immediately able to verify the claims.Slovakia\u2019s outgoing government will not provide additional weapons to Ukraine, said Ludovit Odor, the country\u2019s prime minister, according to Slovakia\u2019s Tasr news agency. The announcement came days after the party of a populist, pro-Russian politician, Robert Fico, came out on top in a parliamentary election. Fico has said he would seek to continue humanitarian aid to Ukraine.As U.S. support for Ukraine wobbles, European Union takes up membership question: Even in the best of times, expanding the E.U. to include Ukraine and others would be a costly, complex and politically perilous process, report Emily Rauhala, Beatriz R\u00edos and Robyn Dixon. The war in Ukraine multiplies the difficulties. Joining the bloc takes years. Countries such as Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Albania and Bosnia have been in membership talks for years. Turkey, which applied to join in 1987, remains a candidate.Over the past year, Ukraine has worked closely with E.U. officials to undertake reforms that would start to bring it in line with requirements.

Rates of the disease have already risen eight-fold globally since 2000, driven largely by climate change as well as the increased movement of people and urbanization.Many cases go unrecorded, but in 2022 4.2 million cases were reported worldwide and public health officials have warned that near-record levels of transmission are expected this year. Bangladesh is currently experiencing its worst-ever outbreak, with more than 1,000 deaths.\u201cWe need to talk much more proactively about dengue,\u201d Jeremy Farrar, an infectious diseases specialist who joined the World Health Organization in May this year, told Reuters.\u201cWe need to really prepare countries for how they will deal with the additional pressure that will come\u2026 in the future in many, many big cities.\u201dFarrar previously spent 18 years working in Vietnam on tropical diseases including dengue. He later headed up the Wellcome Trust global health charity and advised the UK government on its COVID-19 response before joining the WHO in May this year.Farrar said the infection is likely to \u201ctake off\u201d and become endemic in parts of the United States, Europe and Africa - all regions where there has already been some limited local transmission - as global warming makes new areas hospitable to the mosquitoes that spread it. That will put acute pressure on hospital systems in many countries, he warned.\u201cThe clinical care is really intensive, it requires a high ratio of nurses to patients,\u201d he said. \u201cI really worry when this becomes a big issue in sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d[1/2]Mosquitoes are seen on stagnant water on the roadside during countrywide dengue infection, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, August 24, 2023. REUTERS/Mohammad Ponir Hossain/File Photo  Acquire Licensing RightsMost people who get dengue do not have symptoms, meaning case rates are thought to be far higher than the reported numbers. Those who do can experience fever, muscle spasms and joint pain so severe it is known as \u201cbreak-bone fever.\u201d In severe cases \u2013 less than 1% - it can be fatal.There is no specific treatment for dengue, although there is a vaccine available. Earlier this week, the WHO recommended Takeda Pharmaceuticals' (4502.T) Qdenga vaccine for children aged 6 to 16 in areas where the infection is a significant public health problem.Qdenga is also approved by the EU regulator, but Takeda withdrew its application in the United States earlier this year, citing data collection issues. Takeda said it was still in talks with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration about the vaccine.Preparing new regions of the world to deal with dengue means ensuring that any public health funds get spent in the right areas, Farrar said, including on the best way to control the mosquito.Dengue is spread by infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which behave differently to the malaria-carrying kind. For example, they bite people indoors, and they bite all day rather than overnight. They also breed in very shallow water.Farrar said proper prevention would include triaging plans for hospitals as well as scientific innovation alongside other key factors, such as urban planning, to avoid areas of standing water near or in houses.\u201cWe need to combine different sectors that are not used to working together,\u201d he said.Keep up with the latest medical breakthroughs and healthcare trends with our newsletter Reuters Health Rounds.

Geravand\u2019s injury also comes as Iran has put its morality police \u2014 whom activists implicate in Amini\u2019s death over her alleged loose hijab \u2014 back on the street, and as lawmakers push to enforce even stricter penalties for those flouting the required head covering.  \u201cGirls are subjected to violence on the streets, and then their families are compelled to protect the government responsible for that violence,\u201d said Hadi Ghaemi, the executive director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran.            \n   In this image from surveillance video aired by Iranian state television, women pull 16-year-old Armita Geravand from a train car on the Tehran Metro in Tehran, Iran, Sunday, Oct. 1, 2023. The mysterious injury suffered by Geravand not wearing a headscarf while boarding a Metro train in Iran\u2019s capital has reignited anger just after the one-year anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini and the nationwide protests it sparked. (AP Photo/Iranian state television)       For observant Muslim women, the head covering is a sign of piety before God and modesty in front of men outside their families. In Iran, the hijab \u2014 and the all-encompassing black chador worn by some \u2014 has long been a political symbol as well, particularly after becoming mandatory in the years following the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iran and neighboring Taliban-ruled Afghanistan are the only countries where the hijab remains mandatory for women.Amini died in a hospital on Sept. 16, 2022, after she was detained by Iranian morality police on allegations of improperly wearing the hijab. Suspicions that she was beaten during her arrest led to mass protests that represented the largest challenge to Iran\u2019s theocratic government since the revolution.Since those large-scale protests subsided, many women in Tehran can be seen without the hijab in defiance of the law.Geravand suffered her injury Sunday morning at the Meydan-E Shohada, or Martyrs\u2019 Square, Metro station in southern Tehran. Rumors about how she suffered the injury quickly circulated. By Tuesday, the Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, which reports on abuses in Iran\u2019s western Kurdish region, published a photograph it said showed Geravand at the hospital, her head wrapped in bandages as she remains in a coma.  Geravand \u201cwas physically attacked by authorities in the Shohada station at Tehran Metro for what they perceived as noncompliance with the compulsory hijab,\u201d Hengaw alleged, citing reports it said it received. \u201cAs a result, she sustained severe injuries and was transported to the hospital.\u201dThe Associated Press has not been able to confirm the exact circumstances of what caused Geravand\u2019s injuries. Hengaw claimed Thursday that security forces arrested Geravand\u2019s mother, Shahin Ahmadi. Authorities in Tehran did not immediately acknowledge the claim, though semiofficial news agencies denied it.Late Wednesday, Iranian state television aired what appeared to be nearly all the surveillance camera footage covering the 16 minutes Geravand spent inside of the Metro station before her injury. She entered at 6:52 a.m., then went down an escalator. The sole gap, about a minute and a half, occurs before she reaches the turnstile gate where she uses her Metro card. The footage includes her shopping for a snack, then walking to and waiting on the platform for the train. In the mute footage, Geravand, whom activists describe as a taekwondo athlete, appears calm and healthy. An AP frame-by-frame analysis of the footage showed no signs of the aired video being manipulated. At 7:08 a.m., Geravand enters the No. 134 train car \u2014 the last on the train and likely a women-only compartment. A new conductor for the train walks up as she enters, his body blocking the view of door she walks through. Within four seconds, a woman steps backwards out of the train and just a sliver of Geravand\u2019s head can be seen as she lies on the floor of the train. Women then pull Geravand\u2019s limp body out and run for help as the train moves off. Iranian state TV\u2019s report, however, did not include any footage from inside the train itself and offered no explanation on why it hadn\u2019t been released. Most train cars on the Tehran Metro have multiple CCTV cameras, which are viewable by security personnel. \u201cRefusing to publish the footage only increases doubts about the official narrative,\u201d the Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights said. Emergency medical technicians took Geravand to Fajr Hospital, which is at a Iranian air force base and one of the the closest medical facilities to the station. In the time since her injury, security forces have arrested a journalist for Shargh newspaper who went to the hospital, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. Shargh, a reformist newspaper, helped lead reporting surrounding Amini\u2019s death as well.Already, Geravand\u2019s injury has drawn international attention, something Iran\u2019s government has sought to dismiss. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock wrote online: \u201cOnce again a young woman in #Iran is fighting for her life. Just because she showed her hair on the subway. It\u2019s unbearable.\u201d U.S. Deputy Special Envoy for Iran Abram Paley also wrote that he was \u201cshocked and concerned about reports that Iran\u2019s so-called morality police have assaulted 16-year-old Armita Geravand.\u201dIranian authorities likely worry about this incident escalating into popular anger like in Amini\u2019s case. Women continue to ignore the hijab law despite the growing crackdown. That includes what Shargh described as Tehran\u2019s city government hiring of some 400 people as \u201chijab guards\u201d to give verbal warnings, prevent uncovered women from entering subway cars and hand them over to police."}, "42": {"source_API": "NewsAPI", "mercury_worked": true, "query_name": "Top Headlines - US", "source_article": "ESPN", "title_article": "Justin Fields Bears beat Commanders to end 14-game losing streak - ESPN - ESPN", "description_article": "Justin Fields and the Chicago Bears put on a first-half show against the Washington Commanders at FedEx Field on Thursday.", "url_article": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38577968/justin-fields-bears-beat-commanders-end-14-game-losing-streak", "urtToImage_article": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F1006%2Fr1234574_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "publishedAt_article": "2023-10-06T03:36:00Z", "content_article": "playDJ Moore goes off for 230 yards and 3 TDs in Bears' 1st win (1:10)DJ Moore tallies eight receptions, 230 yards and three touchdowns in the Bears' victory over the Commanders. (1:10)Oct 5, 2023, 11:36 PM ETLANDOVER, Md. -- Justin Fields and the Chicago Bears put on a first-half show against the Washington Commanders in a 40-20 win at FedEx Field on Thursday.Fields threw for three touchdowns in the opening two quarters -- two to DJ Moore and one to Cole Kmet -- to help the Bears to a 27-3 lead at halftime.The Commanders opened the second half with a touchdown on their first drive, but the deficit proved too big as the Bears held on to snap a franchise-worst 14-game losing streak that dated back to last season.The win moved Chicago to 1-4 on the season. Washington dropped to 2-3 with the loss.AP Photo/Alex BrandonChicago BearsThe Bears had enough of the negativity, of the outside noise, of the heartbreak they had endured for 11 straight months. On a short week with no time to waste on distractions, Chicago ended its 14-game losing streak and beat the Commanders on the road.Last week, Fields felt the Bears' offense was finally beginning to show its identity. After a lightning-fast start and third-quarter lull, Chicago showed it could finally put away an opponent and leave nothing in doubt in the final minutes of the game.One week after giving up 21 points en route to a devastating loss, the Bears' 20-point win is tied for the fourth largest in NFL history by a team entering on a double-digit losing streak.Buy/sell a breakout performance: DJ Moore found the end zone on two of Chicago's five scoring drives in the first half. His Randy Moss-like catch over Commanders cornerback Kendall Fuller and first-half stat line (five catches, 137 yards, 2 TDs ) helped the Bears build a 24-point lead going into the half and even had LeBron James marveling at the receiver's explosiveness on X. Moore's fourth-quarter touchdown -- his third of the game -- put the game away for Chicago on a night when he notched the second-most receiving yards in a game (230) by a Bears receiver.Encouraging trend: The Bears sacked Commanders QB Sam Howell five times -- which is great considering the team had only two sacks in its four previous games -- but two of those were generated by linebacker T.J. Edwards and cornerback Greg Stroman Jr. (who also recorded the team's first interception of the season against a starting quarterback). Chicago remains committed to pressuring with its four down linemen, but the line didn't break through until Yannick Ngakoue brought down Howell on second-and-9 in the fourth quarter. DeMarcus Walker and Rasheem Green recorded two more sacks late.QB breakdown: Fields became the first Bears quarterback to throw for three or more touchdowns in back-to-back games since the 1970 merger. He built upon his three good quarters against the Denver Broncos and has completed 43 of 64 pass attempts for 617 yards, eight touchdowns and one interception in his past two games, complete with a 131.2 passer rating. Most importantly, Fields didn't let a slow start to the second half hinder him from putting the game away when he found Moore for a 56-yard touchdown with 4:18 to play.Next game: vs. Minnesota Vikings (1 p.m. ET, Oct. 15)Brad Mills/USA TODAY SportsWashington CommandersThe Commanders' defense was supposed to provide a foundation while their offense matured. Instead, the defense sabotaged yet another game.The Commanders allowed at least 30 points for a fourth consecutive game in losing to the Chicago Bears 40-20 on Thursday night. The Commanders (2-3) have lost three consecutive games, including their past two home games by a combined 77-23 score.It's one thing to lose at home to Buffalo; it's another to lose at home to previously winless Chicago. Considering the Commanders have a young quarterback in Howell, the defense needed to provide a lot more. Instead, it gives up big plays and has not caused a turnover in the past two games.The defense talked all offseason and summer about starting fast, knowing that the unit added only one new starter in linebacker Cody Barton, in addition to first-round corner Emmanuel Forbes. But the Commanders have been bad. Thursday, they allowed an offense that ranked 21st entering the game in both points and yards to score a season-high 40 points and gain 451 yards. Washington needs to make it work with this group. It had a chance to gain momentum with upcoming games at Atlanta and the New York Giants. Instead the team exits this game with many questions about its defense -- and its future.Troubling trend: Washington's defense continues to allow too many big plays. The Commanders entered having allowed 13 plays of 25 yards or more, tied for worst in the NFL. Then they allowed three more in the first half alone Thursday night en route to a 27-3 deficit. A huge culprit has been a secondary that has looked inconsistent. Rookie Emmanuel Forbes, who was benched in the second half, has struggled mightily allowing big plays. There were, once more, big gaps in coverage that Fields exploited.Troubling trend, part 2: Poor pass protection. This has been another season-long problem as Howell was sacked five more times, giving him 29 for the season. The Bears, who entered with two sacks in four games, applied consistent pressure with four-man rushes and blitzes. Some of the problems stem from Howell needing to progress through his reads quicker. But the line has been too inconsistent in this area and needs to provide more help for a quarterback who now has six starts to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.QB breakdown: Howell's growth remains pivotal to the franchise's future. Howell showed, once more, that he's a resilient and tough quarterback. After a rough first half -- 9-for-13, 71 yards and an interception -- he threw for 298 yards in the second half. He moved well in the pocket, was patient with underneath throws, and though the Commanders lost, he continued to show he can be developed. Speeding up his progressions and learning to protect himself from hits should be points of emphasis going forward.Next game: at Atlanta Falcons (1 p.m. ET, Oct. 15)"}, "43": {"source_API": "NewsAPI", "mercury_worked": true, "query_name": "Top Headlines - US", "source_article": "Eonline.com", "title_article": "Why Suki Waterhouse Took a \"Bout of Celibacy\" Before Dating Robert Pattinson - E!

All I can say is we\u2019ll do whatever is best for the country and the Republican Party,\u201d Trump told reporters outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan on Wednesday during a break from his civil fraud trial.\n  \n\n  \n      Republican Reps. Troy Nehls of Texas and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia had publicly said they would support Trump for the role. \n  \n\n  \n      If he did run, Trump would need to earn the majority of the votes of lawmakers present and voting, which could prove difficult for a former president who is polarizing even among members of the GOP conference. Rep. Mike Lawler, a GOP freshman from a swing district in New York, told CNN earlier Thursday that he doesn\u2019t see a role for Trump in the speaker\u2019s race. \n  \n\n  \n      Asked by CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto whether he wanted the former president to come to the Capitol, Lawler said, \u201cI think the choice for speaker will be someone who is currently a member of Congress and I think these discussions should be among the members.\u201d \n  \n\n  \n      And even if Trump were to be elected, it\u2019s unclear whether he could get around House Republican conference rules that state any member who is indicted on felony charges that carry a prison sentence of two or more years is required to step down from leadership. Those rules are self-enforced and could be changed \u2013 but only after a speaker is elected.\n  \n\n  \n      This headline and story have been updated with additional information."}, "47": {"source_API": "NewsAPI", "mercury_worked": false, "query_name": "Top Headlines - US", "source_article": "USA Today", "title_article": "Donald Trump says he would accept House speaker job, but a GOP lawmaker predicts he'll back Jim Jordan - USA TODAY", "description_article": "Trump told Fox Digital he would take the speaker of the House job on a short-term basis, though a GOP lawmaker said he'll endorse GOP Rep.

However, despite the similarities, cases for the original Pixel Watch won\u2019t support the Pixel Watch 2.  At a glance, and even on close inspection, the Pixel Watch 2 looks virtually identical to the original model. It has the same waterdrop display, the same overall size, just about everything. But, as it turns out, things are just different enough to break support for existing accessories. If you take a look at Amazon and search for Pixel Watch cases, you might see a trend among some brands that have changed their listings to say that the products are \u201cnot for Pixel Watch 2.\u201d Spigen, Caseology, and some others note the difference.  So, what\u2019s the problem? As it turns out, tweaks to the hardware on Pixel Watch 2, mainly the crown, cause most existing accessories from the original Pixel Watch to simply not be compatible. That is, if they involve the crown or button. It\u2019s such a minor change, that it\u2019s hard to see, but side by side you can see that the new crown is slightly bigger, and that the second button is also just a tiny bit different. We also noticed that, on the other side, what looks like a microphone cutout has been repositioned.  Basically, if you were hoping to score a case for the Pixel Watch 2, don\u2019t buy anything just yet. Given the speed at which those accessories arrived last year, you won\u2019t be waiting long.

More than 60,000 are still in the city\u2019s care.\nThe situation has consumed nearly all of Adams\u2019 energy and created a political crisis for the mayor \u2014 his once-close relationship with Biden has been sullied; the two haven\u2019t spoken in months.\nTaking international relations into his own hands, Adams set off on a whirlwind trip \u2014 with NYPD officers, top aides and reporters in tow \u2014 that will take him through Mexico, Ecuador and Colombia, including the dangerous Dari\u00e9n Gap, over the next several days.\nThe tour was shaping up to be a frenetic combination of fact-finding mission, public-service campaign and self-aggrandizement of his mayoral brand that included receiving an honorary degree in Puebla.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdams touted his foreign relations bona fides by citing several meetings with dignitaries during the recent United Nations General Assembly.\n|\nFernanda Pesce/AP Photo\n\n\n\n\nAdams \u2014 who in the past has brushed off criticism of his penchant for mixing religion with governance \u2014 touched down in Mexico City on Wednesday evening and headed to a holy site for Catholic pilgrims called the Basilica de Guadalupe, where he got an after-hours tour and spoke in sweeping terms about the scope of the solutions needed to stem the flow of migrants.\n\u201cThere are enough resources around the globe to address this issue,\u201d Adams said outside the deserted chapel grounds. \u201cI\u2019m going to do the best I can to send a message to all of the countries dealing with this that we have an obligation.\u201d\nImmigrant experts and Washington officials were skeptical that a junket by a U.S. mayor \u2014 paid partly with government funds for his security detail, personal money by his aides and by a nonprofit for his travel \u2014 would do much to advance those goals.\nFor one, the problems that have led to the increase in asylum-seekers are complex and have been building for years.\n\u201cA single trip by a politician will not dampen the flow,\u201d said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration attorney and professor at Cornell Law School. \u201cMayor Adams would do better to work cooperating with the Biden administration on this complex issue, rather than striking out on his own foreign policy pursuits.\u201d\nIndeed, many of the goals of Adams\u2019 trip \u2014 to liaison with Latin American leaders and deliver a message to migrants \u2014 are already done on a far larger scale by the federal government.\nThe Department of Homeland Security, according to a spokesperson, said the agency has been sending out messages to potential asylum-seekers in their own countries to combat misinformation promulgated by smugglers who present themselves as the best option to reach the southern border.\n\u201cThe mayor\u2019s biggest power isn\u2019t in Mexico: He has no federal or international relevance,\u201d said one Washington official who works on the migrant issue and was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the mayor\u2019s sojourn. \u201cHis gravitational force is strongest in Washington, and if he wants to make a point about Mexico, he should be doing it there.\u201d\nOn Thursday, meanwhile, the Biden administration announced the United States will again start deporting migrants to Venezuela to try to slow the flow from the troubled South American country \u2014 from where a large segment have come to New York. And a day earlier, the administration said it would resume construction in Texas of the Trump administration\u2019s proposed border wall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stop to meet with lawmakers was one of three Thursday where Adams (third from left) was honored by Mexican dignitaries.\n|\nFernanda Pesce/AP Photo\n\n\n\n\nStill, Adams\u2019 trip also drew criticism back home from Democrats and Republicans as a political stunt.\nCity Council Member Alexa Avil\u00e9s, a Democrat, called Adams\u2019 tour \u201cdevoid of any socio-economical context of why migrants are leaving their countries.\u201d\n\u201cOur city needs a lot right now, and we need somebody who\u2019s going to be focusing on finding solutions to the things we need now,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a tourist person to go to the Dari\u00e9n water gap who thinks he\u2019s going to convince individuals not to come to New York City. It\u2019s absurd.\u201d\nAdams, who also sat down with business leaders and met with a social service organization assisting migrants, is being accompanied on his trip in Mexico by Jorge Islas L\u00f3pez, the consul general of Mexico in New York City.\nThe mayor, pushing back against naysayers, touted his foreign relations bona fides by citing several meetings with dignitaries during the recent United Nations General Assembly.\n\u201cWe know we are considered an international city and the playbook for resolving this issue is one on a local level, a state level, a national level and an international level,\u201d Adams said in the ornate chambers of the Puebla state congress building.\nThe stop to meet with lawmakers was one of three Thursday where Adams was honored by Mexican dignitaries \u2014 creating a sharp rhetorical detour from the stated purpose of the trip.\nIn addition to the commendation bestowed upon him by Pueblan lawmakers, Adams was also granted an honorary degree from the Benem\u00e9rita Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Puebla, where he spoke from a wooden parapet to a crowd seated beneath arched porticos and hanging chandeliers about the need to turn academic theories into real-world solutions.\nAdams then raced over, escorted by a multimodal police detail, to a separate ceremony where he was given further awards by the Pueblo state governor and feted over dinner.\nThursday evening, Adams was slated to fly to Quito, Ecuador, where he plans to meet with government officials and chat with migrants. A stop Saturday includes a visit to the treacherous Dari\u00e9n Gap, which many asylum seekers pass through on their harrowing journey to the United States.\nAnd while the mayor hopes to convince some of the migrants he reaches in person or via local media to reconsider their trip to New York City, asylum-seekers already on the ground in the five boroughs did not give him good odds.\nEric Vega, 13, said he arrived from Ecuador with his two siblings and parents a month ago and disagreed that Adams\u2019 description of New York being full would have dissuaded him from making the trek.\n\u201cNew York is really nice,\u201d Vega said in an interview Wednesday outside of an emergency shelter for migrants in Queens. \u201cThey give you food. They give you clothes here in New York. They give you what you need. There\u2019s good people here.\u201d\nEmily Ngo and Jason Beeferman contributed to this report."}, "52": {"source_API": "NewsAPI", "mercury_worked": true, "query_name": "Top Headlines - US", "source_article": "PBS", "title_article": "WATCH LIVE: Winner of 2023 Nobel Peace Prize announced - PBS NewsHour", "description_article": "The 2023 recipient will be announced Friday, Oct. 6.", "url_article": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-live-winner-of-2023-nobel-peace-prize-announced", "urtToImage_article": "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2023/10/GettyImages-101976160-1024x687.jpg", "publishedAt_article": "2023-10-06T00:45:20Z", "content_article": "Imprisoned Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday in recognition of her tireless campaigning for women\u2019s rights and democracy and against the death penalty.\nWatch the event live in the player above.\nMohammadi, 51, has kept up her activism despite numerous arrests by Iranian authorities and spending years behind bars.\n\u201cThis prize is first and foremost a recognition of the very important work of a whole movement in Iran with its undisputed leader, Nargis Mohammadi,\u201d said Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee who announced the prize in Oslo.\nShe said the committee hopes the prize \u201cis an encouragement to continue the work in whichever form this movement finds to be fitting.\u201d She also urged Iran to release Mohammadi in time for the prize ceremony on Dec. 10.\nFor nearly all of Mohammadi\u2019s life, Iran has been governed by a Shiite theocracy headed by the country\u2019s supreme leader. While women hold jobs, academic positions and even government appointments, their lives can be tightly controlled.\nLaws require all women to at least wear a headscarf, or hijab, to cover their hair as a sign of piety. Iran and neighboring Afghanistan remain the only countries that mandate it.\nIn a statement to The New York Times, Mohammadi said the \u201cglobal support and recognition of my human rights advocacy makes me more resolved, more responsible, more passionate and more hopeful.\u201d\n\u201cI also hope this recognition makes Iranians protesting for change stronger and more organized,\u201d she added. \u201cVictory is near.\u201d\nMohammadi has been imprisoned 13 times and convicted five times, according to Reiss-Andersen. In total, she has been sentenced to 31 years in prison. Mohammadi\u2019s most recent incarceration began when she was detained in 2021 after she attended a memorial for a person killed in nationwide protests sparked by an increase in gasoline prices.\nShe has been held at Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin Prison, whose inmates include those with Western ties and political prisoners. Physical and sexual abuse of women in prisons, something Mohammadi has campaigned against both outside of and behind bars, remains endemic.\nMohammadi is the 19th woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize and the second Iranian woman, after human rights activist Shirin Ebadi won the award in 2003\nIt\u2019s the fifth time in the 122-year history of the awards that the peace prize has been given to someone who is in prison or under house arrest. Last year, the top human rights advocate in Belarus, Ales Bialiatski, was among the winners. He remains imprisoned.\nMohammadi was behind bars for the recent protests over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody. That sparked one of the most intense challenges ever to Iran\u2019s theocracy. More than 500 people were killed in a heavy security crackdown while over 22,000 others were arrested.\nFrom behind bars, she contributed an opinion piece for The New York Times.\n\u201cWhat the government may not understand is that the more of us they lock up, the stronger we become,\u201d she wrote.\nThere was no immediate reaction from Iranian state television and other state-controlled media. Some semiofficial news agencies acknowledged Mohammadi\u2019s win in online messages, citing foreign press reports.\nBefore being jailed, Mohammadi was vice president of the banned Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran. Ebadi, who Mohammadi is close to, founded the center.\nIn 2018, Mohammadi, an engineer, was awarded the Andrei Sakharov Prize. Earlier this year, PEN America, which advocates for freedom of speech, gave Mohammadi its PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award. The organization applauded her win.\nThe choice \u201cis a tribute to her courage and that of countless women and girls who have poured out into the streets of Iran and faced down one of the world\u2019s most brutal and stubborn regimes, risking their lives to demand their rights,\u201d PEN America CEO Suzanne Nossel said in a statement.\nThe Nobel Prizes carry a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor (about $1 million). Winners also receive an 18-carat gold medal and diploma at the award ceremonies in December.\nIn addition to Bialiatski, human rights activists from Ukraine and Russia also shared last year\u2019s prize, in what was seen as a strong rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin after his invasion of Ukraine.\nOther previous winners include Nelson Mandela, Barack Obama, Mikhail Gorbachev, Aung San Suu Kyi and the United Nations.\nUnlike the other Nobel prizes that are selected and announced in Stockholm, founder Alfred Nobel decreed that the peace prize be decided and awarded in Oslo by the five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee. The independent panel is appointed by the Norwegian parliament.\nThe peace prize was the fifth of this year\u2019s prizes to be announced. A day earlier, the Nobel committee awarded Norwegian writer Jon Fosse the prize for literature. On Wednesday, the chemistry prize went to U.S.-based scientists who study quantum dots \u2014 whose applications include electronics and medical imaging.\nThe physics prize went Tuesday to three scientists who gave us the first glimpse into the superfast world of spinning electrons.

A risk of flash flooding is possible as it quickly moves through the area.As of 11 a.m. on Friday, the storm was 110 miles away from Bermuda with 50 mile per hour winds. Post-Tropical Philippe is moving north/northeast at a 16 mph. The 11 a.m. advisory was the final advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center as Philippe is no longer a tropical entity. The remnants of this storm will approach the coast of eastern Maine, Nova Scotia or New Brunswick.         \n        \nAs Post-Tropical Philippe nears Maine, it will interact with a developing cold front approaching from the west. Heavy rainfall and gusty winds from the combined systems will impact the region with the most significant impacts along the Midcoast. The timing of the storm would bring rainfall to the area on Saturday and perhaps into Sunday morning.\nA Flash Flood Watch has been issued for central and eastern Maine from Saturday afternoon through Sunday morning. Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations. Storm drains and ditches may become clogged with debris from Fall foliage.        \nA High Surf Advisory has been issued for Sunday.

Ron DeSantis on Thursday delivered some of the sharpest criticism of Donald Trump to date, blaming the former president for his own defeat in 2020 and suggesting his chief rival in the GOP nominating fight lacked the energy to lead the country once again.\n  \n\n  \n      What started as a campaign event to promote support from Florida sheriffs ended with DeSantis skewering Trump in a series of rejoinders that make clear his intentions to recast the race around the former president\u2019s perceived shortcomings. \n  \n\n  \n      In an unmistakable shot at Trump\u2019s age and stamina, DeSantis quipped, \u201cWe don\u2019t need any more presidents that have lost the zip on their fastball.\u201d He said the party\u2019s nomination shouldn\u2019t be a coronation, especially for \u201canybody that couldn\u2019t even stop Joe Biden.\u201d\n  \n\n  \n      Regarding the 2020 election, he said people were \u201cvoting against Trump,\u201d undercutting the ongoing lies about a stolen election from the former president and his supporters \u2013 including failed congressional candidate Laura Loomer, who heckled DeSantis from outside his Tampa event with a bullhorn that rattled aides as her voice carried into the venue.\n  \n\n  \n      \u201cLet\u2019s just be honest, he energized Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could have John Kennedy walk through the door right now and he wouldn\u2019t energize Democrats as much as Donald Trump does.\u201d \n  \n\n  \n      The remarks come as DeSantis has shifted to a more aggressive approach in recent weeks as the urgency to diminish Trump has intensified. \n  \n\n  \n      Still, the sharp-tongued attacks from DeSantis on Thursday were striking in what they signaled for the weeks ahead. DeSantis, who once fiercely defended and then attempted to ignore Trump, appears prepared to go full-throttle at his former ally to make up for his large polling deficit. \n  \n\n  \n      Democrats have already seized on the breakdown in their relationship. After DeSantis called Trump \u201cmissing in action\u201d at the debate and said the Trump administration\u2019s spending \u201cset the stage for the inflation,\u201d President Joe Biden shared a clip on social media, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n  \n\n  \n      The latest round of attacks were largely provoked by questions DeSantis faced during the Tampa event. One man who identified himself as a DeSantis supporter asked how the Florida governor will defeat a candidate who \u201cfills stadiums.\u201d \n  \n\n  \n      DeSantis quickly shot back: \u201cNot anymore.\u201d \n  \n\n  \n      \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: a voter that goes to 10 rallies, their vote counts the same as somebody that\u2019s unenthusiastic and then goes and votes. And we just have to understand that,\u201d he continued. \n  \n\n  \n      But DeSantis also took a shot without provocation at Trump\u2019s failed promise to build a wall at the southern border and make Mexico pay for it. DeSantis told the crowd he would finish what Trump could not.\n  \n\n  \n      DeSantis later questioned Trump\u2019s fundraising numbers \u2013 which the Trump campaign announced Wednesday just hours after DeSantis released his. The Trump campaign reported it brought in more than $45.5 million during the period that spanned July 1 to September 30, compared to the DeSantis campaign\u2019s $15 million. \n  \n\n  \n      Only $5 million of the DeSantis dollars can be spent toward the primary, while Trump has nearly $36 million designated for use in the primary, his campaign said. \n  \n\n  \n      Those figures cannot be independently verified until federal election reports are made public later this month. But DeSantis said he believes that the math will show he is still ahead. DeSantis has a super PAC that was seeded with nearly $83 million left over from his 2022 gubernatorial campaign.\n  \n\n  \n      Trump has continued to use his legal troubles to encourage donations from supporters. DeSantis encouraged people to look at how Trump is spending those contributions.\n  \n\n  \n      \u201cWhy is he raising that money? And where\u2019s that money going to?\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cIsn\u2019t it going to a lot of lawyers?\u201d"}, "57": {"source_API": "bing", "mercury_worked": true, "query_name": "NFT News - Bing", "source_article": "Inferse", "source_icon": "", "title_article": "PancakeSwap Attains Majority Share of TVL on Aptos Chain \u2013 BSC NEWS", "description_article": "PancakeSwap now accounts for more than 50% of the TVL on the growing Aptos chain, mirroring its status as the dominant DEX on BNB Chain.The chefs have done it", "url_article": "https://www.inferse.com/744738/pancakeswap-attains-majority-share-of-tvl-on-aptos-chain-bsc-news/", "urtToImage_article": "https://www.inferse.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/wp-header-logo-4240.png", "publishedAt_article": "2023-10-07T07:43:00.0000000Z", "content_article": "PancakeSwap now accounts for more than 50% of the TVL on the growing Aptos chain, mirroring its status as the dominant DEX on BNB Chain.The chefs have done it again. PancakeSwap has broken the 50% barrier in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL) on the Aptos blockchain, meaning the majority of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) funds are on the platform.PancakeSwap is not only the dominant Decentralized Exchange (DEX) on both BNB Chain and Aptos, but it is head-and-shoulders above competing DeFi Decentralized Applications (Dapps) on those chains. The DEX marked its Aptos achievement with a celebratory Tweet.\ud83d\udcc8 We've reached new heights as we've achieved over 50% dominance on @Aptos_Network. \ud83e\udd1dIt's a testament to the team's hard work and dedication, as well as the community's support. pic.twitter.com/xdSv2cSzeCAccording to DefiLlama, PancakeSwap has captured 53% of TVL on Aptos and 44% on BNB Chain \u2014 with those figures rising if you exclude liquid staking numbers.The DEX has $29.5 million in TVL on Aptos and $2.3 billion on BNB Chain \u2014 in each case, nearly three times the TVL amount of the next-ranked Dapp.While overall TVL on BNB Chain has essentially flatlined since Summer 2022, the TVL on Aptos has steadily increased since the chain launched in October.However, PancakeSwap is still taking tiny nibbles out of the biggest flapjack of them all, Ethereum, with $12.6 million out of the chain\u2019s total TVL of $48.7 billion (approximately 2.5%).Like a prison cafeteria, major DEXes are eyeing their rivals\u2019 plates on other blockchains, with Ethereum\u2019s UniSwap considering taking a bite out of BNB Chain and Avalanche\u2019s Trader Joe having a BNB Chain \u201ctable for two\u201d reserved for its DEX and NFT Marketplace.PancakeSwap is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) built on BNB Chain. It offers users various features such as Liquidity Pools, Swapping, Yield Farming, Syrup Pools, Automated Market Maker, Initial Farm Offering (IFO), NFT profile system, and many others.In addition, the protocol helps users make the most out of their crypto assets by trading, earning through yield farming, and winning via lottery, prediction, and NFT collectibles. With the highest trading volumes in the market, PancakeSwap is the leading DEX on the BNB Chain.Website | Twitter | Medium | GitHubAptos is a new, independent project focused on delivering the safest and most production-ready Layer 1 blockchain in the world. The team includes the original creators, researchers, designers, and builders of Diem, the blockchain that was first built to serve this purpose.Website | Twitter | Telegram | Medium | Discord |Previously known as the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), BNB Chain is a community-driven, decentralized, and censorship-resistant blockchain that is powered by Binance. It consists of BNB Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain, EVM compatible and facilitating a multi-chain ecosystem. Through the concept of MetaFI, BNB Chain aims to build the infrastructure to power the world\u2019s parallel virtual ecosystem.Website | Twitter | Discord | Telegram | GitHub |These developments have reportedly impacted Ethereum's appeal in terms of yield, with the total staking yield dropping to about 5.5%. SummaryIn a recent research report, JPMorgan highlighted growing centralization concerns within the Ethereum network following the Merge and Shanghai upgrades. Led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, JPMorgan analysts wrote; \"The rise in Ethereum staking since the Merge and Shanghai upgrades has come at a cost as the Ethereum network became more centralized and as the overall staking yield declined.\"Lido stands out as a beacon of hope in the quest for decentralization. The platform has been strategically adding more node operators to ensure that no single entity exerts undue control over staked Ether. Such concentration, according to the Wall Street bank, could potentially lead to catastrophic outcomes, including creating an oligopoly that disregards the community's interests.The report further emphasizes the lurking risk of rehypothecation within the DeFi landscape. As liquidity tokens are increasingly reused as collateral across various DeFi protocols, a sharp decline in the value of staked assets or malicious attacks could trigger a cascade of liquidations, shaking the ecosystem.Ultimately, these developments have also impacted the appeal of Ethereum from a yield perspective, as the total staking yield has dipped from 7.3% pre-Shanghai upgrade to approximately 5.5%. Against the backdrop of surging yields in traditional financial assets, Ethereum's centralization concerns call for immediate attention to safeguard the network's core principles and security.SponsoredBuy Crypto with a bank transfer, credit or debit card, P2P exchange, and more.

Most lead to massive financial losses on the investor\u2019s part with the NFT movement entrenched in fraud and oversaturation. \u201cDidn\u2019t this guy help fund the development of his game with NFT skins of all things?\u201d asked Insider Gaming\u2019s Tom Henderson on Oct. 6. Replies to the post have been generally critical of Dr Disrespect\u2019s stance given his involvement with NFTs and cryptocurrency. \u201cIt\u2019s like Logan Paul being an advocate against internet scams,\u201d said one user. Not only did Dr Disrespect promote a volatile financial investment such as NFTs, but he outright defended the decision. He claimed that NFTs won\u2019t be required to play his game and that it \u201cwon\u2019t be pay-to-win.\u201d Nonetheless, he was then met with a heavy backlash from players and creators alike, with some prominent figures from the video game industry chiming in.  Seeing as his game\u2019s snapshots are still available only to those who claimed his NFT \u201cFounders pass,\u201d he hasn\u2019t changed his mind about using microtransactions as a source of income. With that in mind, his criticism of the gaming world and the industry\u2014though they may ring true to some degree\u2014is hypocrisy at worst. In any case, the gaming community is progressing, and no one knows how the trend of microtransactions and skins will expand (or shrink) in the future. One thing is certain, though: a good game is enough to make it profitable purely by word of mouth. Just look at Baldur\u2019s Gate 3; If Larian Studios can pull it off, with a little effort, so can everyone else\u2014including the almighty Dr Disrespect."}, "62": {"source_API": "bing", "mercury_worked": true, "query_name": "NFT News - Bing", "source_article": "Yahoo News", "source_icon": "", "title_article": "Starbucks Is Now Selling Pumpkin Spice NFTs", "description_article": "Starbucks partnered with NFT marketplace Nifty Giveaway for the \"drop.\" Instead of limiting the total number of tokens sold, Starbucks is selling the \"digital stamps\" exclusively between October 5 and October 9.

From Louis Vuitton's $39,000 virtual treasure trunk that will supposedly grant buyers access to \"twinned\" physical products to Salesforce building out a market for\u00a0other companies to create NFT loyalty programs, it's obvious that companies that hedged their bets on these digital assets aren't giving up the ghost just yet.It remains to be seen if there's any crossover between NFT bros and PSL junkies, but given how fast the last ones sold out, there's a non-zero chance that they may end up being worth more than the $20 Starbucks is charging for them \u2014 which, to be fair, is only about $12 more than the price of an IRL PSL.More on the food biz: Snack Food CEO Vows to Battle Ozempic"}, "63": {"source_API": "bing", "mercury_worked": true, "query_name": "NFT News - Bing", "source_article": "Benzinga.com", "source_icon": "https://www.bing.com/th?id=ODF.LnWAsYULk4XKw3udkffflQ&pid=news", "title_article": "Unlocking the Future of Online Gaming with NFTs: Why BotFi Wallet Leads the Way", "description_article": "In the ever-evolving landscape of online gaming, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have emerged as a groundbreaking technology that promises to revolutionize the way we interact with digital assets within the gaming universe.", "url_article": "https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/23/10/ab35134454/unlocking-the-future-of-online-gaming-with-nfts-why-botfi-wallet-leads-the-way", "urtToImage_article": "None", "publishedAt_article": "2023-10-06T22:25:00.0000000Z", "content_article": "In the ever-evolving landscape of online gaming, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have emerged as a groundbreaking technology that promises to revolutionize the way we interact with digital assets within the gaming universe.

The article centered on questions of how SBF planned to handle his massive new fortune: Would he follow through on his promises to give it all away or become just another billionaire making empty promises of philanthropy?Nearly a year and a half after that article was published, Bankman-Fried is \u2026 going on trial for fraud. Now Faux and others are wondering: What does the massive rise and even more massive fall of crypto\u2019s golden boy mean for the rest of the industry?On Friday\u2019s episode of What Next: TBD, I spoke with Faux, also the author of Number Go Up: Inside Crypto\u2019s Wild Rise and Staggering Fall, about crypto\u2019s flight toward the sun\u2014or was it the moon? Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.Lizzie O\u2019Leary: The whole crypto industry really rests on the idea of a stablecoin, something that is supposed to be backed, one-to-one, with fiat currency. The heart of your book is your investigation of Tether, which everybody was relying on to be solid, and yet the minute you start researching it, it\u2019s like a parade of red flags. Can you take me through the start of your journey looking into Tether?Zeke Faux: It\u2019s 2021. Janet Yellen calls a meeting of all the top financial regulators. They all walk over to the Treasury Department and they have a meeting about crypto and Tether, the stablecoin. Does it really have $50 billion in the bank? And if it doesn\u2019t, could the financial system collapse\u2014not just the crypto world, the whole real world?So, I hear about this, and I\u2019m thinking it must be somewhat legit if it has risen to this level. I start looking into it. First off, the CEO and the CFO are never seen in public\u2014there are no interviews. It\u2019s unclear where the company is. They\u2019ve implied they\u2019re regulated by the British Virgin Islands. So, I email the financial regulator there, and I say, \u201cDo you regulate Tether? Do you have any records on them?\u201d And he is like, \u201cNo, we have never regulated Tether.\u201d I still think they might be supposed to. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s very hard to untangle.A lot of people were skeptical of Tether, but a lot of logic and reasoning seem to go out the window because \u201cnumber go up.\u201d If everybody believes that the thing is going to be more valuable, then the thing is more valuable. What does that tell you about the mentality behind all of this?You can think of Tether as casino chips. If you need these casino chips to gamble at this amazing crypto casino where everyone\u2019s getting rich, then you\u2019re willing to overlook any flaws in this casino chip system. And similarly, in the book, I buy an NFT, which is essentially a digital picture of a monkey that I paid $20,000 for. But the process of buying it was so horrible that I thought, Who would do this if they did not think they were going to get rich?The appeal of \u201cnumber go up\u201d has to be there to get people to send their money to FTX, this weird offshore company, or to buy dogecoin, or to go through this whole struggle to buy an NFT. Why would I want to get into crypto if I wasn\u2019t going to get rich? I said to a lot of the founders, \u201cI\u2019m not saying your coin\u2019s going to crash, but it can\u2019t go up forever. If it\u2019s just flat, why is anyone going to do this?\u201d And people did not have good answers for that question.Maybe this is a stupid question, but why did the number go up? Why did people think that they could make money forever?It\u2019s hard to say. I think that low interest rates made venture capital funding available to a lot of these really speculative crypto companies.Companies that were throwing off big yields. So instead of putting your money in something that made cents, you might put your money in something that was promising a 20 percent yield, right?Yeah. In this last crypto bubble, which I think will never be matched, a lot of the companies were promising yield, and you couldn\u2019t get yield elsewhere. If you\u2019re a company trying to be serious about it, you can\u2019t just say, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve got this coin and it\u2019s the best.\u201d You need a whole pitch about how we\u2019re going to have staking and there\u2019ll be yield and you\u2019ll earn 10 percent. That sucked in a lot of people.And there was a lot of money available. People had stimulus checks. They were bored. I don\u2019t know exactly how it got started, but once it started going up, it was such a powerful story. If you hear about somebody who made money on crypto, you want to do it too. For a while, it just seemed like everybody was doing it and you were kind of a sucker if you didn\u2019t.You put the Ponzi scheme question to multiple people in this book, and a lot of them were like, \u201cWell, yeah.\u201d What did you make of that?They have this saying, \u201cWe\u2019re all going to make it.\u201d WAGMI. The idea behind it was: If we all buy and don\u2019t sell, the number will go up and we\u2019re all going to be rich and it\u2019s going to be so awesome. But it just doesn\u2019t work. We can\u2019t all get rich. The number can\u2019t go up forever.Major banks, big players were all thinking about crypto and trying to take it seriously. What does that tell you about the financial system, that you have a bank like JPMorgan saying, \u201cWell, maybe we ought to take a look at this thing\u201d?If any normal company even coughs in the direction of bitcoin, the crypto world turns it into a big headline that we all talk about and create this impression that the mainstream world is really interested in crypto. I think the mainstream financial world\u2019s attitude is more like, \u201cMany people are trading crypto; they\u2019re willing to pay fees to do so. I guess maybe we should facilitate that and get some fees.\u201d I did not see too many major players making big bets with their own money on the coin prices going up.More like, \u201cIf you guys want to be stupid, we\u2019ll help you\u201d?Exactly.Remember that Tether was supposed to be stable, one Tether backed by one U.S. dollar, but it was really hard to tell what that one-to-one backing really meant. In fact, those Tethers were backed, but not necessarily by dollars\u2014more like exotic loans.Tether had invested quite a lot in short-term loans to Chinese companies. They\u2019d made loans to other crypto companies. I spent two years looking into this, traveling around the world, trying to get to the bottom of the whole crypto mania. Even as all the other companies started to blow up, Tether did not\u2014the one company that I thought was the most worthy of investigation actually survived this crypto collapse that killed nearly every other company that I came across.And just started lending again.Yeah. Now that interest rates have climbed, Tether\u2019s business model is unbelievable. The pot of money has grown to $80 billion. They can take that and invest it in U.S. treasuries, which are very safe and earn 5 percent a year. Tether is now one of the most profitable companies in the world. It makes higher quarterly profits than Nike.What do you do with that?I just continually ask myself why people are trusting Tether. Because in the crypto world, a lot of the pitch was \u201cIt\u2019s trustless. You don\u2019t have to trust.\u201d But we\u2019ve found, again and again, that you do have to trust. And if the people running the company are untrustworthy, they may come up with some way to take your money. In the case of Tether, the company has been sued by the New York attorney general for lying about its reserves.The biggest question behind all of this\u2014the losses, the gains, the crazy stories\u2014is whether, when we talk about crypto, we are talking about some bad bets or about fraud. And that brings me back to Sam Bankman-Fried. The U.S. government has charged him with seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. Much of the trial will turn on whether he was knowingly misleading his lenders and inappropriately using his customers\u2019 money for huge, wild, speculative bets through FTX\u2019s sister hedge fund, or, as Bankman-Fried maintained in his apology tour after FTX collapsed, that it was a case of confusion and bad management. How do you feel about the profile you wrote of SBF back in 2022?I was sitting right there with a guy running a giant financial fraud. I\u2019m an investigative reporter. My job is to identify these financial frauds, and I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t feel good about that. I wish I had been the guy who spotted it and who alerted the world to it earlier.How much do you think his message to you\u2014that he was going to give his money away, his involvement with effective altruism, all of those appearances in Washington\u2014contributed to people saying, \u201cWell, this guy seems good\u201d?The pitch that he was going to save the world was kind of suspicious. But what actually helped him gain my trust was that when he was talking to people who were skeptical of crypto, he would act like he was also skeptical of crypto.He seemed like the grown-up in the room who didn\u2019t buy into \u201cnumber go up\u201d thinking and came across as one of those Wall Street guys who was creating an app. If people wanted to go gamble on crypto, they could do it on his app and he was going to make money. And, by all accounts, the app was great\u2014it worked really well for gambling on crypto.It seems like there was a logical way he could have become really, really rich and achieved his goals without doing anything fraudulent. I mean, it would\u2019ve been possible.What I didn\u2019t suspect, and what basically no one suspected, was that he had this offshore crypto casino where he was essentially stealing the money out of the back of the casino and taking it to other casinos to buy dogecoin. That was not on my radar. I was caught off guard when that was revealed to be the truth.You were back in the Bahamas about a week after FTX collapsed. What did you expect to find there?FTX had failed. Sam had not yet been charged with anything, he hadn\u2019t gone on his big apology tour yet, and I wanted to know what had happened. It looked really bad. It seemed pretty clear to me: $8 billion was gone; news was coming out about sketchy things that had happened with this money. It seemed pretty clear that fraud had been committed. But I wanted to hear Sam\u2019s side of it, and I thought, Even if he\u2019s not going to admit to anything, maybe there\u2019s something to be learned by hearing his explanation for this.There are times in poker where the best play can be to go all in, to bet all your money. And even if it doesn\u2019t work out, the fact that you end up losing doesn\u2019t mean it was a bad bet\u2014maybe you just got unlucky and the other guy pulled the ace of spades and beat you. So, I stayed up really late one night because he keeps odd hours, and I sent him a message essentially asking him, \u201cDid you make some sort of mistake, or did you just get unlucky and you had made the right play?\u201dHe said that was kind of an intriguing question. Then I said, \u201cGreat. I\u2019ll be in the Bahamas tomorrow. See you soon.\u201d After a few more days of suspense, when it wasn\u2019t clear if he was going to speak with me, he invited me up to his $30 million penthouse to talk about this question for the whole day.What did he say?Honestly, we were prevented from having the kind of discussion that I wanted because he knew that he was in legal jeopardy and needed to lay the groundwork for his criminal defense. He thought he was going to go testify before Congress, so when I met him, he was working on the speech he was going to give there, which never happened because he got arrested.But that speech was supposed to start \u201cI bleeped up,\u201d and that was sort of his pitch to me. He fully acknowledged that the $8 billion was gone, and he wasn\u2019t even really disputing that his hedge fund had used that $8 billion and lost it. Instead, he was trying to say that he did not know that was happening and that he basically just wasn\u2019t paying attention and lost track of everything. I mean, these are very big numbers.Whoops, I lost 8 billion.I was like, \u201cSam, are you really saying you just misplaced $8 billion?\u201dAnd then he said to me, looking kind of pleased with himself, \u201cMisaccounted.\u201dHe got out his computer and was typing on a spreadsheet, trying to show me what he thought the $8 billion had been spent on and how he could have possibly imagined that it was less money. And he was trying to say that he was paying so little attention he did not even notice how much money was going out the door.I told him that I didn\u2019t think this was very plausible.Then he started talking about the people who were in charge of his hedge fund, which includes Caroline Ellison, who was his friend. They dated at times, and as he was talking about this, his explanations were long. And I said to him, \u201cSam is the TL;DR of this explanation \u2018My ex-girlfriend did it\u2019?\u201dAnd he was just like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know who did it.\u201dI\u2019m thinking to myself, This guy will probably get arrested soon. He could spend decades in prison, and he\u2019s going to be in court saying, \u201cMy ex-girlfriend did it.\u201d That doesn\u2019t sound like something that Congress or a jury will ever like.Is this trial the end of crypto? Or is it just a weird little speed bump?I don\u2019t think that the fate of crypto is on trial. We\u2019ve seen so many companies, not just Sam\u2019s, that were hailed as potentially the future of finance or art or the internet\u2014and they\u2019ve all come to nothing. The next time that somebody pitches \u201cI\u2019ve got this new coin, and I\u2019m going to create this metaverse soon and that we\u2019re all going to live on the blockchain,\u201d I don\u2019t think it will have the same appeal.I think the only thing that crypto proved to be any good for was gambling. And then Sam ruined that by turning one of the best casinos into a big scam."}, "66": {"source_API": "bing", "mercury_worked": true, "query_name": "Business Search - US - Bing", "source_article": "Mint", "source_icon": "https://www.bing.com/th?id=ODF.W8vM8p2PIvfc6Sh2F0nZpA&pid=news", "title_article": "IRCTC share price: Why experts see big upside in short term \u2014 explained", "description_article": "ICC World Cup 2023 is expeted to benefit IRCTC as hotels, flights, trains, buses, etc are expected to surge during the cricket tournament, say experts", "url_article": "https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/irctc-share-price-why-experts-see-big-upside-in-short-term-explained-11696666562769.html", "urtToImage_article": "https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2023/10/07/1600x900/IRCTC_share_price_ICC_World_Cup_2023_stocks_to_buy_1696666820332_1696666820640.JPG", "publishedAt_article": "2023-10-07T08:27:00.0000000Z", "content_article": "Stock to buy: Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation or IRCTC share price has given strong upside movement in the week gone by.

Bryan, who most recently served as GM of the Ottawa Senators and passed away from colon cancer in 2017, had a remarkable 35-year career in coaching and management. Terry played for Philadelphia, Washington and Detroit before moving behind the bench for the Capitals, Flyers, Panthers and Kings.Then whenever Teena's uncles would return home during the offseasons, the business became a gathering spot of sorts for the family.\"I was supposed to be working, but we'd stand around all summer and just talk hockey,\" Teena said with a laugh. \"The lessons I learned there and just the relational side of this business\u2026 knowing how to talk to people and knowing just how to really understand the culture of team sport and what it takes\u2026 I learned all of that back then from them.\"With the sport in her blood, Murray always had a lot of interest in eventually getting back to hockey during her career on the performance side of sports that's spanned over 20 of them - and an incredible opportunity to do just that has come with the Penguins.Murray was recently named the team's Senior Vice President of Integrated Performance, where she will oversee the hockey operations' strength and conditioning staff, rehabilitation, sports science and medical staff and report directly to general manager Ron Hextall.\"This opportunity to lead the growth and development of more of an integrated performance team at this time was one that I just felt I couldn't pass up, with the championship culture that's already in place,\" said Murray, who has spent the past four seasons as vice president of health and performance for the NBA's Sacramento Kings.\"I have known Ron for quite some time, I've known of (president of hockey operations Brian Burke) for a long time, and I'm excited about their vision and what they're doing there. I just feel like the time was right.\"Murray got started on her particular path in sports somewhat organically. As an athlete herself, she had always enjoying being in the weight room while playing college basketball and studying kinesiology at Wilfrid Laurier University in Canada.When Murray arrived at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro to pursue her master's degree in exercise physiology and sports nutrition, she got an assistantship with the softball team - where she was able to take advantage of the knowledge she had built up through her own experiences.\"They had this great weight room, but they had no strength coach,\" Murray said. \"So I just started taking our team in there as part of their training, and I started writing the program.\"That started a ripple effect, which led to the basketball and volleyball coaches asking if she could put together programs for their teams as well. Murray loved that type of work so much that she got her strength and conditioning certification, and as she was finishing her degree, realized she wanted to continue working with different sports and athletes on the performance side.\"I was really into my own training and nutrition and all of these things, and I just kind of took my passion, my hobby, and made it a career,\" she said.Murray now has over 25 years of experience working with professional and collegiate teams. Prior to her time in Sacramento, Murray spent 14 years at the University of Louisville as the director of sports performance, where she built an NCAA-leading high-performance sport program that served 21 Division I Top-25 sports.She has also worked as either a strength and conditioning coach or consultant for various teams/organizations throughout her professional career. On the hockey side, that includes the Anaheim Ducks, Hartford Wolfpack and the Panthers. Murray also won two World Championship gold medals, as well as a silver medal at the 2010 Olympic Games, with Team USA - where she served as the first-ever Director of Performance for the U.S. Women's National and Olympic hockey teams from 2006-10.\"A lot of the players had been trying to find their own strength coaches wherever they were going to school or wherever they were working, and so it was the first time that USA Hockey brought someone on board as the director of performance to manage all aspects of training and development,\" Murray said. \"I had a chance to spend four years building this program.\"That was a transformative experience for Murray, as not only did she have the opportunity to work closely with elite athletes - but also with talented people who specialized in areas like biomechanics, physiology and other related spaces at the Olympic Training Centers in Lake Placid and Colorado Springs. After returning to Louisville following the Vancouver Games, Murray was inspired to start implementing that high-performance approach with the athletes there.\"Over time, we were able to add nutrition and psychology and begin adding analytics,\" Murray said. \"We built a really impressive performance analytics department at Louisville, and started integrating data across all teams. So that's I guess kind of where these philosophies, if you will, were birthed.\"Murray has become known for pioneering that type of high-performance approach in elite sport. Instead of the traditional setup where all of the different silos, like medical and strength and conditioning, can get isolated from each other, Murray champions an interdisciplinary approach where everyone is fully integrated and interconnected, with systems that drive such collaboration.\"We work very collaboratively to individualize everything that we do for each player,\" Murray said. \"There's no doubt it's difficult to do that in a team sport, but it's very possible. And we certainly want to use data to inform some of the decision-making to better manage the care and performance of every player.\"Throughout Murray's entire life, she's grown used to being the only female, whether it was playing boys' hockey as a kid or as she progressed throughout her career. When she first arrived in Sacramento, it was just her and one administrative assistant upstairs, and that was it. But they've since diversified, as Murray was able to hire two women onto her staff, and she's proud to play a part in continuing the growing visibility of women in sports.\"There's no doubt I believe in lifting as you rise, and so every time I've had a chance to move into more of a management role, a leadership role, I make it a high priority to try to create opportunities for other females,\" Murray said.And now, she can't wait to get started in the one she has in front of her.\"I'm thrilled,\" Murray said. \"I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity. Really, really excited to be joining Burkie and Hexy, and can't wait to get started.\""}, "69": {"source_API": "bing", "mercury_worked": false, "query_name": "Business Search - US - Bing", "source_article": "Business Standard", "source_icon": "https://www.bing.com/th?id=ODF.6yYEGE61ig4jYI6NTUmjjg&pid=news", "title_article": "Untenable, bogus: NewsClick rejects allegations levelled in FIR against it", "description_article": "The NewsClick portal has rejected as untenable and bogus allegations levelled in a Delhi Police FIR against it, and said the proceedings initiated are \"nothing but a blatant attempt to muzzle the free and independent press in India\".", "url_article": "https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/untenable-bogus-newsclick-rejects-allegations-levelled-in-fir-against-it-123100700310_1.html", "urtToImage_article": "https://www.bing.com/th?id=OVFT.P1-bzNwo3hXdpzGQuXtL9C", "publishedAt_article": "2023-10-07T08:25:00.0000000Z", "content_article": "https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/untenable-bogus-newsclick-rejects-allegations-levelled-in-fir-against-it-123100700310_1.html"}, "70": {"source_API": "bing", "mercury_worked": true, "query_name": "Business Search - US - Bing", "source_article": "VentureBeat", "source_icon": "https://www.bing.com/th?id=ODF.qPCJA3Or4GGU4hhi1ZEpfg&pid=news", "title_article": "October, 2023\u2019s most crowded month, is here | Kaser Focus", "description_article": "GamesBeat Next unites gaming industry leaders for exceptional content, networking, and deal-making opportunities.

No wonder Alone in the Dark ran scared from this release window. It\u2019s been another downer of a week, with layoff news coming from Telltale Games, Team 17 and Naughty Dog. We\u2019ve also heard news that several former Ubisoft executives have been detained by French police, who are investigating claims of sexual assault and harassment at the company (details of which broke in several 2020 reports). Even as we celebrate the deluge of fantastic games this month, it pays for us to also remember the people who made them \u2014 many of whom no longer have jobs.

Drug and staffing shortages haven\u2019t gone away. Stores are starting their busiest time of year as customers look for help with colds and the flu. And this fall, pharmacists are dealing with a new vaccine and the start of insurance coverage for COVID-19 shots.Some drugstores have addressed their challenges by adding employees at busy hours. But experts say many pharmacies, particularly the big chains, still don\u2019t have enough workers behind the counter.Chris Adkins said he left his job as a pharmacist with a major drugstore chain a couple years ago because of the stress. Aside from filling and checking prescriptions, Adkins routinely answered the phone, ran the register and stocked pharmacy shelves.\u201cI just didn\u2019t have time for the patients,\u201d he said. \u201cI am OK working hard and working long hours, but I just felt like I was not doing a good job as a pharmacist.\u201dIn recent years, drugstores have struggled to fill open pharmacist and pharmacy technician positions, even as many have raised pay and dangled signing bonuses.Larger drugstore chains often operate stores with only one pharmacist on duty per shift, said Richard Dang, an assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California. That kind of thin staffing can make it hard to recruit employees. \u201cI think that many pharmacists in the profession are hesitant to work for a company where they don\u2019t feel supported,\u201d said Dang, a former president of the California Pharmacists Association.Customers have noticed.John Staed, of Pelham, Alabama, said a CVS pharmacist gave him the wrong prescription about a decade ago: the pills were a different color than usual. He worries the chances for another mistake could increase as pharmacists take on more work.\u201cThese pharmacists always look stressed,\u201d he said.A CVS spokeswoman said the company is focused on addressing concerns raised by its pharmacists and has taken several actions, including \u201cproviding additional pharmacy resources\u201d in markets that need support. She declined to say how many pharmacists or technicians the company has hired. Former Walgreens CEO Rosalind Brewer said in late June that the company had added more than 1,000 pharmacists in the second quarter, but was running into a shortage of job candidates. Walgreens is adding processing centers around the country to ease some of the prescription workload for its stores. Brewer, who left in late August, also said the company was limiting hours at 1,100 pharmacies, or about 12% of its U.S. locations. That was down from 1,600 earlier this year, but a company executive has said it doesn't expect to return all pharmacies to normal operating hours by year's end. Labor strife and staffing shortages in health care are not isolated to drugstores, as the recent Kaiser Permanente strike shows.But drugstores have some additional challenges in the fall. Many customers come to them for vaccines for COVID-19, flu and pneumonia. Plus, federal officials have approved a new shot for people ages 60 and older for a virus called RSV.All told, CVS touts in a pharmacy counter brochure that the company can offer more than 15 vaccines to customers. Ongoing drug shortages also have kept pharmacy workers on the phone more.Jonathan Marquess said one of his drugstores fielded 100 questions one day last fall about the antibiotic amoxicillin and the attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder treatment Adderall, two drugs in short supply.Marquess runs several independent pharmacies in Georgia and serves on the National Community Pharmacists Association board. He has done a few things to help his stores adapt to the extra workload, he said, including training all employees to answer basic questions about vaccines. Marquess also adds extra staff when he knows they will have an influx of customers, like when a nearby company sends its employees over for vaccines. \u201cWe learned from our experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cTraining your entire staff is very, very important.\u201dPharmacists say customers aren't powerless and can help things run smoothly.People should bring all their insurance cards to vaccine appointments, especially since insurance coverage is new for the COVID-19 shots, Marquess said.Dang said customers should avoid showing up right after pharmacies reopen from a lunch break or just before they close, times when pharmacists and technicians are especially busy.Making appointments for vaccines gives pharmacy workers a better sense for their workload. Calling several days in advance for a prescription refill also helps, said Jen Cocohoba, a pharmacy professor at University of California San Francisco.\u201cThat tiny piece of control can help, because there\u2019s so many things you cannot predict when you\u2019re inside the community pharmacy,\u201d Cocohoba said.___ AP Business Writer Josh Funk contributed to this report."}, "72": {"source_API": "bing", "mercury_worked": true, "query_name": "Business Search - US - Bing", "source_article": "Business Insider", "source_icon": "https://www.bing.com/th?id=ODF.LrIq_5vxtu4ONs5zIW54FA&pid=news", "title_article": "Bitcoin mining without mining equipment, CGMD miner opens contract trading", "description_article": "CGMD miner opens contract trading.London, United Kingdom - October 7, 2023 \u2014 As more players enter the cryptocurrency space, mining becomes", "url_article": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/bitcoin-mining-without-mining-equipment-cgmd-miner-opens-contract-trading-1032685717", "urtToImage_article": "https://storage.googleapis.com/mmstudio-images/gallery/0Qs0EITqVZabcNzobJLcG7NxPF53/1696574874311-0.jpg", "publishedAt_article": "2023-10-07T08:14:00.0000000Z", "content_article": "CGMD miner opens contract trading.London, United Kingdom - October 7, 2023  \u2014 As more players enter the cryptocurrency space, mining becomes more complex and requires more computing power.

That money, he said, is then placed in accounts in countries such as Turkey and the UAE, where western sanctions are not closely enforced.\u00a0Under Western sanctions, banks must investigate suspicious transactions to make sure they're not being used to circumvent sanctions. So Russia attempts to obscure the real source of the money by using intermediary banks.\u00a0The purchases, Verkhniatskyi said, are brokered by networks of shell companies, which are often covers for Russian intelligence, These firms usually buy the sanctioned goods from trading firms or retailers in bulk he said.Countries like Kazakhstan and Armenia, with traditionally close ties to Russia and weaker business laws, are used as bases for the shell companies.\u00a0Verkhniatskyi described the shell companies as \"sleeping bears\" some of which were set up before the invasion and were ready to activate once Western sanctions began to bite.Banks dealing in dollars, the world's default currency, in theory have to comply with American sanctions or face reprisals from the US government.But Kremlin agents have other options available that don't involve bank transfers that could trigger such checks, Verkhniatskyi said.\u00a0Some shell company agents hand over suitcases full of cash to suppliers or other valuables.\"There is also information on Russians using diamonds as payment methods for sanctioned goods,\" Verkhniatskyi said, citing Ukrainian government sources.\u00a0His claims are backed by a recent report by the UK's Serious Organised Crime & Anti-Corruption Evidence group. It found that the Kremlin's illicit cash flows are not just funding its tech procurement programs, but also disinformation campaigns and militant groups.\"Illicit finance is now an integral part of Russia's foreign and security policy,\" wrote Professor David Lewis from the University of Exeter in the study. \"It is also critical to the Russian military and security services, enabling illicit defence supply chains, facilitating military deployments overseas, and funding a growing array of parastate military units.\"But Russia lacks the capacity to buy the large numbers of banned tech items it needs through cash handovers alone, meaning it remains vulnerable to attempts to restrict the flow of Kremlin money through banks.Blacklisting Russia\u00a0Verkhniatskyi said a vital step would be Russia on the blacklist of the Financial Action Task Force blacklist, an inter-governmental organization meant to stop financial wrongdoing. The move effectively isolates a country from the world's banking systems.\u00a0The FATF briefly suspended Russia in the wake of the Ukraine invasion, a largely symbolic move meaning it was restricted from involvement at a leadership level.But it has so far hesitated in taking the more serious step of blacklisting Russia, amid concerns it could impact the neutrality of the FATF, and might not be effective.\u00a0Only three countries were blacklisted as of October 2023: North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar. A larger \"grey list\" of more than 25 countries also does not feature RussiaBut Verkhniatskyi dismissed these concerns, and said that not punishing Russia was doing more damage to the institution's credibility.\u00a0\"I think that the authority of FATF is undermined when they sit at the same table with the criminal state and keep on you know, working as normal,\" he said.The FATF did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider."}, "74": {"source_API": "bing", "mercury_worked": true, "query_name": "Business Search - US - Bing", "source_article": "Boston Herald", "source_icon": "https://www.bing.com/th?id=ODF.vMHf-n5tMCT_gVSWxntzhg&pid=news", "title_article": "Lowry: Trump wages \u201924 campaign from court", "description_article": "Donald Trump is starring in a real-life drama about partisan prosecutors and the Biden Justice Department trying to annihilate his business and jail him ahead of the 2024 election.", "url_article": "https://www.bostonherald.com/2023/10/07/lowry-trump-wages-24-campaign-from-court/", "urtToImage_article": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/OCR-Z-TRUMP-LIVE-0825-mugshot-1.jpg?w=1024&h=575", "publishedAt_article": "2023-10-07T08:09:00.0000000Z", "content_article": "Donald Trump is getting indicted and tried all the way into a third Republican presidential nomination, and perhaps a second term in office.\nTrump\u2019s court dates and legal entanglements aren\u2019t a distraction from his campaign, as some observers predicted; in large part, they are the campaign.\nWe\u2019re all familiar with the so-called front-porch campaigns of the late-19th century, most famously the Republican William McKinley who would have delegations of supporters visit him at his home in Canton, Ohio. Joe Biden built on the concept with his lockdown-compliant basement campaign during the 2020 campaign (at least McKinley interacted with real people).\nNow, Trump has come up with another variant of this concept \u2014 the courtroom campaign.\nIt involves massive media attention before, during and after court appearances; images and statements of bold, unadorned defiance; and inflamed Republican emotions from the sense that he is being treated unfairly.\nThis is the potent political cocktail that Trump has used to build what appears to be a nearly unassailable lead in the Republican primaries. Perhaps GOP voters were going to swing toward Trump no matter what, or maybe the struggles of the Ron DeSantis campaign have played a big role. But everything suggests that, so far, Trump\u2019s legal travails have been political gold. Every key juncture of Trump\u2019s legal drama has allowed him to dominate the fight for media coverage, which, as we learned in the 2016 nomination battle, is key terrain in a primary.\nIt used to be that candidate debates were, besides some traditional occasions (a state fair, a party dinner), the most important events on the political calendar. No more. So there was a nice initial Republican debate in August? Well, the next day there was an instantly iconic Trump mugshot everywhere on TV and social media.\nThere was another, not-so-great Republican debate in September. Who cares? Trump showed up at his civil fraud trial in New York City the following Monday.\nWhen much of the Republican Party is in a state of high alarm about the instruments of the establishment being used against the right, Donald Trump is starring in a real-life drama about partisan prosecutors and the Biden Justice Department trying to annihilate his business and jail him ahead of the 2024 election.\nWhat else is going to generate more interest and sympathy among perhaps a decisive proportion of Republicans\nthan that?\nIt only helps Trump that, despite his sundry deceptions and disgraceful conduct, the myriad legal actions against him are generally ridiculous at worst and ambiguous and legally adventurous at best, while almost all represent blatant selective prosecution.\nNot for the first time, Trump and his enemies have a symbiotic relationship \u2014 they want to destroy him by any means necessary, and he uses their enmity as his chief political calling card.\nThis time, the stakes are higher than ever, and we could be heading to a true \u201cGotterdammerung\u201d next year, with a major-party presidential candidate at risk of going to jail months before a national election.\nRich Lowry is editor in chief of the National Review"}, "75": {"source_API": "bing", "mercury_worked": true, "query_name": "Business Search - US - Bing", "source_article": "CNN on MSN.com", "source_icon": "https://www.bing.com/th?id=ODF.t0BGYosS4GKZSebCajKQGA&pid=news", "title_article": "Britain invented trains.
